### Overview



At SUTD, we believe in giving our students the flexibility for different pathways and that one-size does not fit all. Students can customise your curriculum to suit your interests and aspirations through the selection of elective courses and **[Specialisation Tracks](/education/undergraduate/specialisation-tracks/)**. You may also pursue a **Minor** to equip yourself with additional knowledge beyond your choice of Major.



##### **Minors**



A minor programme is a coherent course of study in an additional area outside of the Major. It contributes to your breadth of learning and may allow you to gain a competitive advantage in the workplace by being conversant in topics beyond your major. A Minor consists of a collection of 5 subjects required by the department offering the Minor, 2 of which may be cross-listed as meeting the Major requirements while the remaining 3 may be taken as technical electives.



Undergraduate students taking up an engineering Major (CSD, EPD or ESD; students taking DAI are able to choose from a restricted list of Minors) will have the opportunity to select a Minor on top of the Major. You will indicate your choice of Minor at the start of Term 8. Both the Major and Minor requirements must be completed within the normal candidature of the undergraduate programme, i.e. 8 terms.
