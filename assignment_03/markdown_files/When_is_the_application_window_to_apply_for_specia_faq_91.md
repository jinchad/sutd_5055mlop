When_is_the_application_window_to_apply_for_specia



When is the application window to apply for special programmes? Is there a second window for SUTD students to apply for the programmes after they have enrolled in the university?
==================================================================================================================================================================================

The special programmes are available for application at the point of your application for admission to the university. There is no second application window for SHARP. However, if you have been offered and accepted a place in SUTD, you may [indicate your interest to apply for the SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track here](/admissions/undergraduate/ask-admissions/)Â by mid-June, if you had not done so earlier. As the number of places for special programmes are limited, they are also highly competitive.
