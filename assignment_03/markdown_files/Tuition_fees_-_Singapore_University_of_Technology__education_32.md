**Eligibility guidelines for Ministry of Education (MOE) subsidised fee**  
The substantial tuition subsidy from the Government of Singapore comes in the form of a MOE Subsidy which is administered by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and is offered to all admitted students up to the normal programme duration. Students need not apply for the MOE Subsidy if they are eligible.

**i) Students with a higher degree qualification**  
Students who have previously enjoyed MOE subsidy in a graduate programme will not be eligible for MOE subsidy in another graduate programme at the same or lower level. Instead, such students will be required to pay the non-subsidised fees for the graduate programme that they now wish to undertake. For example, students who had previously enjoyed MOE subsidy in a Masters programme and had attained the Masters degree will not be eligible for subsidy in another programme at Masters degree or lower level. In addition, if they wish to upgrade in another discipline area where the programme has a combination of Masters and PhD candidature, they will not be eligible to enjoy MOE subsidy during the Masters candidature.

**ii) Transferred or re-admitted students**  
Students who are transferred or re-admitted within SUTD or across Autonomous Universities\* will be eligible to receive MOE subsidy up to the normal programme duration for the new programme less number of terms of MOE subsidy received for the previous programme.

\* Autonomous Universities refer to Nanyang Technological University (NTU), National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), Singapore Management University (SMU), Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).
