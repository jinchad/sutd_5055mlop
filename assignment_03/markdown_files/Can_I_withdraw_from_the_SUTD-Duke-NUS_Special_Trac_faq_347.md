Can I withdraw from the SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track during the course of my undergraduate studies?
==================================================================================================

Although you are not required to make a binding commitment to Duke-NUS at the time of admission, you should inform SUTD and Duke-NUS of your withdrawal from the track at least the year preceding medical school matriculation. You can still continue with SUTDâ€™s normal undergraduate degree programme should you discontinue with the track, subject to meeting the academic requirements for the undergraduate programme.
