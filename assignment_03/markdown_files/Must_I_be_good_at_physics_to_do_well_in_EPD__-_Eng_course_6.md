Must I be good at physics to do well in EPD?
============================================

At SUTD, all first-year students go through a mandatory Freshmore curriculum which comprises foundational courses which include Physics. This approach provides a broad and rigorous education, and ensures that all students build a strong foundation in Science, Mathematics, Technology and Design to excel in your chosen major (such as EPD).
