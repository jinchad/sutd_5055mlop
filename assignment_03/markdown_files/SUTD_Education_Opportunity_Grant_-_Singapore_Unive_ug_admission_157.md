### SUTD Education Opportunity Grant



The SUTD Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG) aims to help students with demonstrated financial need offset their educational expenses at SUTD. In particular, eligible students with the greatest financial need will be **guaranteed a financial package** equal to **100%** of their tuition fees, as well as full coverage of the mandatory hostel fees during the Freshmore terms.  
  
The quantum of financial support you receive will be tiered based on your financial circumstances. The SEOG will cover the full duration (up to 8 academic terms) of your undergraduate studies as long as you continue to meet the eligibility criteria.  
  
There are no additional selection interviews and no limit to the number of recipients. All students who meet the eligibility criteria will receive the grant. There is also no bond attached to the award.   
  
With this upfront guarantee of financial aid, you can focus on pursuing your interests and passions at SUTD without having to worry about financing.



##### **Eligibility**



The SEOG is open to full-time undergraduates who meet the following criteria:



* Are Singapore Citizens (SC);
* Must not concurrently hold a scholarship, unless approved by SUTD;
* Monthly household Per Capita Income (PCI) of S$2,500 and below; and
* Residing in a 4-room HDB flat or smaller, and family does not own any private property.


##### **Tenure**



The grant is tenable for a maximum of four years (8 academic terms) of undergraduate studies, provided that the recipient continues to meet the eligibility criteria.   
  
Recipients will be required to provide supporting income documents to the Office of Student Administration on an annual basis for re-assessment.



##### **Benefits of Award**

The SEOG, enhanced in AY2020, covers tuition fees and hostel fees. The quantum for tuition fees is tiered based on your household income and is fixed for each cohort after taking into consideration the prevailing tuition fees payable by each cohort.

**Covers up to 100% of tuition fees and hostel fees**
