I_have_obtained_a_loan_under_the_CPF_Education_Loa



I have obtained a loan under the CPF Education Loan Scheme (CPFELS) to finance my tuition fee payable but I have yet to receive a bill for my tuition fee. Why?
===============================================================================================================================================================

Tuition and related fees are billed at the start of the term.



If you have applied for CPF Education LoanÂ Scheme for settlement of tuition fees, please note that the CPF withdrawn amount will only be reflected in your statement of account after Week 3 of the term after due processing.



The amount of funds withdrawn from CPF account is subject to available and eligible funds for withdrawal by CPF Board.
