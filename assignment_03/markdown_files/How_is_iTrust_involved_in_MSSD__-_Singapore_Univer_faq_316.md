How is iTrust involved in MSSD?
===============================

iTrust, Center for Research in Cyber Security, is a leading center for research in cyber security. It focuses on creating design-centric solutions for enhancing the resilience of critical infrastructure through foundational and applied research. iTrust is the host of four world-class testbeds in water treatment, water distribution, smart grid, and IoT. In addition iTrust hosts four custom designed test skids built around Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) widely used in Industrial Control Systems. The PLCs available for experimentation in the test skids are from Allen-Bradley, National Instruments, Schneider Electric, and Siemens. Students in the MSSD program will have unprecedented access to these unique test skids. In addition, iTrust will also provide students access to the testbeds.
