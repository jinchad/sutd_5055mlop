Professional Practice Programme
===============================

### Overview



As part of the mandatory core curriculum, all SUTD undergraduate students are required to complete the **Professional Practice Programme (PPP)** prior to their graduation.   
  
The 8-term programme, starting from Term 1, aims for students to acquire cross-disciplinary attributes covering professional ethics, health risk and safety, sustainability, and environment in the context of professional engineering practice and design.   
  
It is compulsory for all our undergraduates to attend and pass all modules of the programme. By the end of the PPP, our undergraduates will be equipped with essential skills for professional practice.
