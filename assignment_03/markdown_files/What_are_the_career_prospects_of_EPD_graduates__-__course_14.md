What are the career prospects of EPD graduates?
===============================================

EPD graduates are prepared for a wide range of engineering, design and management careers. Your skills and capabilities for leading the development of new products, systems, processes or methodologies prepare you for both the private and public sectors, including healthcare, consumer goods, robotics, finance, defence, and energy and power. Our EPD graduates have gone on to pursue a career in a range of different fields and companies (i.e., private, MNCs, government) or have founded start-ups that were instrumental in addressing societal needs (for e.g. (these)abilities). Some have also chosen to pursue further studies (PhD and Masters) at SUTD or in top tiered overseas colleges (e.g., MIT, Berkley, Stanford, ETH Zurich, EPFL).
