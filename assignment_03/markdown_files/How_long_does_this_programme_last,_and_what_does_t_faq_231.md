How long does this programme last, and what does the commitment look like?
==========================================================================

Typically 3 half-day sessions. You will be guided through in-class discussions and assignments.



As our programmes are designed to take you from zero-to-one in the most efficient way, we encourage you to follow through the full course of the programme. We understand if you have one-off commitments which might affect your attendance, but do make time if you are signing up.
