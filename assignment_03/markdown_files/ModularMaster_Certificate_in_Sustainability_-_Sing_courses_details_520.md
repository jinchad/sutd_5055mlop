Sustainability is changing the nature of business, with investors, regulators, consumers, and employees pushing for corporations to address global issues such as climate change, social injustice, and digital governance. The role of the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) has emerged as the sustainability function professionalises. However, the CSO’s role is often not clearly defined. CSOs are seeking new, transdisciplinary skillsets as they catalyse sustainability outcomes across different business functions.

The ModularMaster Certificate in Sustainability will help CSOs develop the requisite competencies to confidently drive sustainable change in a complex, fragmented, technical, and rapidly evolving sustainability landscape.

##### **Holistic and all-encompassing**

Most sustainability resources focus on a single topic (e.g., reporting), requiring CSOs to spend a lot of time and expense researching various courses to learn from. This one-stop programme amasses the full range of sustainability topics that CSOs will need to gain competence in, from designing sustainability strategies to ESG reporting, sustainable design to sustainable transformation.

##### **In-depth and detailed**

The programme consists of a series of six 5-day courses that delve deep into each aspect of Sustainability and the associated skills and knowledge needed by CSOs. You may choose to take up individual modules separately to build up to a Graduate Certificate and a ModularMaster (MM) at your own pace or choose to take up the MM as a full programme.

##### **Best-in-class**

This programme brings together leading industry practitioners and distinguished professors from various fields, for participants to learn from the best-in-practice. Faculty and guest speakers come from prestigious organisations such as dss+, Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, Imperial College, NVPC, Oracle, Singtel, and UOB. Through expert sharing, case studies, and hands-on practice, participants will be equipped with the most updated domain knowledge.
