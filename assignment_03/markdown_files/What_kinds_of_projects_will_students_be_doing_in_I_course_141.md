What kinds of projects will students be doing in ISTD?
======================================================

1. Software Development  
   ● Python Programming Projects  
   ● Artificial Intelligence Projects
2. Hardware Integration  
   ● Programming with Robots (Arduino)  
   ● Raspberry Pi Projects  
   ● Sphero Projects
3. Software/Hardware Co-design  
   ● Projects integrating both software and hardware components
4. User Experience  
   ● User Interface Design Projects
5. Network and Security  
   ● Networking and Cybersecurity Projects

These projects are delivered through a mix of structured coursework, hands-on laboratory sessions, and workshops. Many ISTD courses feature semester-long projects applying theoretical concepts to practical problems. Capstone courses typically combine knowledge from various classes to address complex, real-world problems in partnership with other SUTD pillars. This approach ensures students gain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, preparing them for diverse technological challenges in the field.
