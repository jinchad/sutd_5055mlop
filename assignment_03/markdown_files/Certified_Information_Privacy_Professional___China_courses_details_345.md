### Overview

This course is designed to explain in depth the China data protection laws.

China is the world’s 2nd largest economy. It has enacted several laws to govern the proper collection, use and sharing of personal data. The law, especially the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), has extra-territorial effect, similar to that of EU GDPR. This means all entities that handle personal data of residents in China will need to comply with the PIPL.

It is essential that organisations understand how to comply with the three major laws (PIPL, DSL and CSL) that govern Chinese privacy. Earning the CIPP/CN credential exhibits comprehensive understanding of Chinese data governance and personal information protection. It also verifies the candidate’s ability to mitigate risk while adhering to Chinese legal and regulatory requirements.

This course will equip personnel with data protection responsibilities, such as Data Protection Officer (DPO), legal counsel, risk and compliance managers, internal auditors, to help organisations in meeting their data protection obligations and gain consumer trust.
