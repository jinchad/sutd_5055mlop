What type of portfolio would be beneficial for the EPD program?
===============================================================

Parts of these questions were addressed during the Virtual Open House Live Talk Q+A segment that can be viewed at this site: <https://live.motionmediaworks.com/video/SUTD-EPD>Â (see Q1). Self-motivated students who have a keen interest in learning, making and creating next generation products that address societal needs should apply to EPD. A portfolio that can demonstrate these aspects would certainly be beneficial. Generally, our educational philosophy is to embrace and enrich individuals with different talents, since every individual can offer a unique contribution.
