What are Honours Sessions and how many sessions do SHARP students need to attend?
=================================================================================

Honours Sessions introduce students to various advance Math and Science topics that are not covered in the Freshmore curriculum and serve to provide pre-research training for students in SHARP. One Honours Session is scheduled per Freshmore Term and classes for the Honours Session are held once or twice a week. SHARP students are required to attend all three Honours Sessions and pass at least 2 Honours sessions in order to continue on with SHARP.
