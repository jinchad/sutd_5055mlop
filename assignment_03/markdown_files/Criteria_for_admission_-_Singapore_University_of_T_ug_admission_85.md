### Criteria for Admission

The University accepts applications from both Science and Arts stream students.

##### **Requirements**

##### **Mother Tongue Language (MTL)**

All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are required to fulfil the MTL requirement for admission into full-time publicly-funded undergraduate programmes in the universities.

Those who have not fulfilled the MTL requirement may still apply for admission with no prejudice to their application. However, if accepted, they will be required to fulfil the MTL requirement during their course of study.

The MTL requirement may be fulfilled through any one of the following:

|  |
| --- |
| **Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level**  * **D7 grade for Higher MTL** * Note: the iGCSE MTL First Language examination does not fulfil the requirement |
| **Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level**  * **Pass in MTL ‘B’** or a **S grade for H1 MTL/ MTL-in-lieu** or **H2 MTL Language and Literature**or**H1 General Studies in Chinese** |
| **International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme**  * **Pass in MTL A: Literature**, or **MTL A: Language and Literature**, or **Language B MTL at Standard or Higher Level** * Note: the IB Standard Level Language ab initio does not fulfil the requirement |

Applicants who have been away from Singapore’s school system for some years and have not kept up with the study of their MTL or a language that can be offered as MTL-in-lieu may apply for MTL exemption. The MTL exemption application will be facilitated by the universities as part of the university application, and the results made known to applicants who receive admission offers from the university. Please note that MOE does not accept direct applications for MTL exemption. The application for MTL exemption will also not prejudice the evaluation of the application for a place in the university.

##### **Computation of University Admissions Score (UAS)**

When computing the University Admissions Score, we will take into consideration the following:

* The best three H2 and one H1 content-based subjects, of which one must be a contrasting subject
* GP or KI (taken in the same sitting as the H2 subjects)
* Project Work (PW)

Please note that SAT and AP scores are optional. Do visit the [US College Board website](https://www.collegeboard.org/) for details and registration. You should indicate 6532 (SUTD Institution Code) on your SAT registration forms, so that the scores will be sent directly to us by the US College Board.

**Revised UAS Computation from AY2026**

From AY2026, the following subjects will be taken into consideration for UAS computation:

* Three H2 content-based subjects
* General Paper (GP)

H1 Mother Tongue Language and/or the fourth H1/H2 content-based subject may be considered if it improves the UAS.  
**Note: From AY2026, H2 Knowledge & Inquiry (KI) will no longer be considered in lieu of GP. If offered, H2 KI will be considered as a H2 content-based subject.**

**Admission Requirement from AY2026**

From AY2026, students will be required to obtain a pass grade in Project Work to be eligible for admission.

##### **Online Application Form**

For each University Admissions Exercise, we only accept one application from you made through our online application form. Duplicate applications will not be processed.

###### I did poorly for my A-Level exams. How can I increase my chances of admission into SUTD?

There are various alternative pathways for you to consider, including:

* Retaking your A-Levels; or
* Further your studies via the polytechnics, which offer module exemptions of up to two semesters for A-Level graduates in selected courses. These module exemptions allow A-Level graduates to graduate with a polytechnic diploma within 2 or 2.5 years, compared to the usual 3 years. More information on the application process and courses on offer can be found on the respective polytechnics’ websites
