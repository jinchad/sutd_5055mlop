The_“Create_Invoice”_button_is_greyed_out_and_cann



The “Create Invoice” button is greyed out and cannot be clicked even though the service had already been rendered. How can I issue the invoice in this case?
============================================================================================================================================================

This can mean either of these two things:

1. ​The current account does not have the authority to issue invoices. In this case, please reach out to your Ariba Administrator.
2. Goods receipt (GR) has not been performed. Please reach out to SUTD contact person if goods/services have been delivered and liaise with them to perform GR.
