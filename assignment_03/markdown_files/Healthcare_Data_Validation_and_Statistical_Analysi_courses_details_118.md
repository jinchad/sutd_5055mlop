### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science (Healthcare)](/course/modularmaster-in-data-science-healthcare/ "ModularMasters in Data Science") programme**

Data Validation and Statistical Analysis are critical components in the field of data science, playing a vital role in ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and meaningful interpretation of data. Through data validation techniques, professionals can verify the integrity and quality of the collected data, identifying and addressing any inconsistencies, errors, or outliers that may impact the analysis. By conducting rigorous statistical analysis, they gain insights into patterns, relationships, and trends within the data, enabling evidence-based decision-making. Statistical analysis allows for hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, regression modeling, and other techniques to draw valid conclusions and make reliable predictions. The combination of data validation and statistical analysis ensures that data-driven insights are robust, trustworthy, and actionable, empowering organizations to make informed choices and achieve meaningful outcomes.

This course, spanning a duration of five days, is specifically designed to equips participants with valuable skills in data exploration, statistical anomaly detection, and dataset validation in healthcare contexts. Over the first four days, participants will learn essential skills related to exploring data distribution, detecting statistical anomalies, and statistically validating datasets. The course will equip healthcare professionals with the necessary tools to analyse healthcare data effectively and make informed decisions based on statistical evidence. Participants will be actively involved in a healthcare-related project throughout the module. The final day, which is split into two half-days on separate weeks, will be dedicated to project consultation and project presentation.
