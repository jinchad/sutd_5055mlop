Early Matriculation
===================

##### **Be recognised as an SUTD Student early – get a headstart by getting involved!**




To help ease your transition to university life, SUTD welcomes students who would like to get plugged into the SUTD community even before the main cohort matriculates in September. The Early Matriculation Exercise is available to SC/PR students who have a place reserved in SUTD for that Academic Year.

| **For Incoming AY2025 Freshmen** |
| SUTD Early Matriculation Exercise 2025 is open for **Singapore Citizen/Permanent Resident** students who have a place reserved in SUTD for the Academic Year 2025 intake. This year, there will be two exercises:  * Early Matriculation @ Spring (January 2025) * Early Matriculation @ Summer (June 2025)   Students who do not wish to matriculate early in January (EM@Spring) may still participate in the early matriculation exercise in June (EM@Summer). Details for the latter will be sent to students in May 2025. |





Through this special exercise, you can re-connect with friends, make new ones, meet future school mates and engage in meaningful activities before classes start formally. Upon completing the matriculation procedures, you will be issued with the official SUTD student card and start enjoying the benefits of an SUTD student!
