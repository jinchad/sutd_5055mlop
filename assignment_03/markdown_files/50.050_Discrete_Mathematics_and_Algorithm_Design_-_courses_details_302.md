50.050 Discrete Mathematics and Algorithm Design
================================================

An in-depth understanding of Computer Science requires strong mathematical foundations. In this course, students will learn the foundations of discrete mathematics and other mathematical areas, with an emphasis on understanding the underlying mathematics for algorithms beyond those covered in 50.004 Algorithms. Through this course, students will appreciate the wide applicability of mathematics for algorithms in artificial intelligence, communications, computer graphics, cybersecurity, data analytics, robotics, etc. Topics include: Counting methods, logic and proof methods, graph theory (incl. graph colorings, matchings, Ramsey theory), graph algorithms (e.g. Fleury’s algorithm, Kosaraju’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm), number theory (e.g. modular arithmetic, Euclidean algorithm), coding theory (e.g. Huffman coding, Hamming codes), convex geometry (e.g. polytopes, Voronoi diagrams), computational geometry (e.g. Fortune’s algorithm, Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm).
