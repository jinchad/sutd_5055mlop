I_received_an_invoice_status_update_notification_e



I received an invoice status update notification entitled “PAID” but I am unable to trace the actual payment in my bank account. How long does it take for the actual payment to be reflected in my bank account after receiving this notification?

It will take up to approximately 5 working days for the funds to reach your bank account.
