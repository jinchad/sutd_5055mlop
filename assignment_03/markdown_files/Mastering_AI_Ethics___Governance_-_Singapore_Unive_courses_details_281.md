### Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being deployed in various applications and solutions worldwide. There is a growing recognition that AI needs to be placed within an ethical framework because of its unique aspects. Senior executives are usually held accountable for any lapses in AI ethics development and/or deployment. Therefore, they must be well-informed about the regulations, the implications, and the frameworks that cover AI ethics in Singapore and overseas. Ignoring the ethical aspects of AI development or deployment could cause serious damage to an organisation’s reputation.

To foster confidence in AI, solution providers and end-users must embrace responsible AI use by prioritising fairness, transparency, explainability, and human-centricity. It is crucial to align internal policies, structures, and processes to uphold ethical standards.

This case-studies based management workshop will provide a broad and deep understanding of the ethical issues surrounding the development and deployment of AI, the regulatory parameters that define AI, and the frameworks that govern it in key countries. This Masterclass will provide you with some tools and governance frameworks to handle AI issues rationally, morally, and ethically.
