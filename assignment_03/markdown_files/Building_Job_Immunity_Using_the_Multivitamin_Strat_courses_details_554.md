### Overview

Today’s workers need to be better prepared for change and crisis; the difference now is that they need to be on the offensive by taking an active role in securing their future. The workshop guides learners through a systematic approach to build job immunity and career resilience, specifically through the reimagination of career pathways and opportunities that are based on one’s unique work and life skills. This Multivitamin approach is grounded in research on career transformations which integrates the lived experiences of workers from multiple industries, roles and disciplines with lessons from external shocks, technological disruptions and career uncertainties. The workshop will deliver a combination of tools and practitioner insights to help workers open their minds to creative new possibilities and apply them immediately to the respective stages of their careers. Learners will also have the chance to discuss pertinent issues around career transformation and feel supported in their personal journey.
