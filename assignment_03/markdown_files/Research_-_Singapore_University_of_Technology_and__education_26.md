Research foci
-------------

The research projects may include, but are not limited to, those offered in [SUTD’s four strategic growth areas](/education/undergraduate/sectors/) – Aviation, Artificial Intelligence, Cities and Healthcare.

###### Healthcare

With the ageing population in Singapore and many other countries, you can contribute to the advancement of healthcare innovation in many areas, from providing technology-enabled solutions that address a wide range of pressing healthcare challenges, to optimising hospital infrastructure and new bio-medical products and systems. SUTD is collaborating with Changi General Hospital and other partner universities to offer research projects in areas such as technology-enabled “smart” healthcare and public health policy.
