###### Materials selection in product design

**Week 5 to 6**  
**Instructor:** [Associate Professor Arlindo Silva](/profile/arlindo-silva/)

**Description:**  
These two sessions will focus on the challenges of selecting appropriate materials and manufacturing processes for product design, with consideration of scaling, environmental effects, and functionality. Basic concepts on design for manufacturing and assembly and product architecture will also be conveyed.

Assessment will be done through a mini-project and presentation at the end of the second session.

###### Quantum Chemical Calculations: From Theory and Practice

**Week 8 to 9**  
**Instructor:** [Associate Professor Liu Xiaogang](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/profile/liu-xiaogang/)

**Description:**  
Chemistry, as the central science, extends its reach across various disciplines, intertwining with mathematics, physics, and engineering. In our journey away from traditional wet lab chemistry, modern computers become our powerful allies, enabling simulations and experiments in a virtual realm. This paradigm shift allows us to address critical scientific questions and foster the development of innovative products in a much more efficient and green manner.

In this mini-course, we embark on an exciting adventure that combines theoretical foundations with hands-on training, all presented at an accessible level. Our focus lies in unravelling the essentials of computational modelling within the realm of photochemistry. Topics covered will include an introduction to density functional theory, basis sets, essential computational chemistry software, and the historical development and fundamental concepts of photochemistry. Through this blended learning, we will explore the molecular origins of greenhouse gases, as well as delve into the UV-vis absorption of dyes.

##### **01.017 SHARP Honours Session Term 3**

###### Metaheuristic Optimisation

**Week 1 to 4**  
**Instructor:** [Assistant Prof Nuno Ribeiro](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/profile/nuno-antunes-ribeiro/)

**Description:**  
Metaheuristics are flexible problem-solving approaches that use inspiration from nature or logic to efficiently explore for solutions within complex search spaces in optimisation. These methods find applications in various industries such as supply chain, logistics, transportation, and robotics. This course delves into key metaheuristic approaches such as neighbourhood search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms.
