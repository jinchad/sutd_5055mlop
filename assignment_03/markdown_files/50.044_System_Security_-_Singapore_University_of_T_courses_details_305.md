50.044 System Security
======================

This course covers the security of users, individual computer systems, including personal computers, smart cards and embedded platforms. The course starts with considerations of common security flaws in a computer system, security of widely used computer platforms and user authentication. Then, topics such as physical‚Äêlayer attacks and tamper resistant hardware are discussed. Finally, the course ends with a set of selected security topics like biometrics, computer forensics, and Bitcoin.

##### **Prerequisites**

* [50.042 Foundations of Cybersecurity](/course/50-042-foundations-of-cybersecurity/)

##### **Learning Objectives**

1. Define security objectives for a given computer system based on problem setting and requirements
