Following their Grand Prize win at the inaugural [JunctionX Singapore](https://singapore.hackjunction.com/), the team of SUTD students participated at the [Junction 2019](https://2019.hackjunction.com/) held in Helsinki, Finland, from 15 November to 17 November 2019.

They won the second place in their [Track Challenge – Bring Mispurchases to an End](https://2019.hackjunction.com/challenges/bring-mispurchases-to-an-end) and were also placed in the Top 3 under the [Bonus Challenge – Best use of Aiven services](https://2019.hackjunction.com/challenges/best-use-of-aiven).

The team developed a personalised virtual skincare assistant, which they named SK5, which diagnoses consumer’s skin conditions through computer vision and recommends suitable skincare products. The recommendation takes into account skin conditions, product ingredients and customer reviews.

Junction 2019 brought together 1500 participants from 100 nationalities, and resulted in 350 new tech projects in just 48 hours.

**Ong Xiang Qian and** **Ian Lim Li Ern are step students who are currently in Berkeley.**
