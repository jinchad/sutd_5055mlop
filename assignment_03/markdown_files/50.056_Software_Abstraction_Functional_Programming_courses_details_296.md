50.056 Software Abstraction Functional Programming
==================================================

This course introduces students to functional programming and how to construct software abstractions. Students learn how to compose functions and perform computation in a functional way. Higher order function will be taught as a way to abstract computation. The course then introduces students on how they can abstract data in functional programming. The students will be brought into a discussion of state-based computation and how it is best done to allow better testing and concurrency. In the later part of the course, students will learn how they can apply many these concepts to create meta circular evaluator and implement lazy evaluations. The course introduces many concepts that inspires various programming languages and, throughout, the idea of software abstraction is emphasised.
