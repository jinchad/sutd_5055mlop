### Overview

##### **Introduction**

This course covers the foundations of internet security (e.g., applied cryptography, key certification, protocol security analysis). It applies foundational techniques to the design of internet protocols that achieve crucial security properties (e.g., confidentiality, authenticity, and message integrity) against powerful but realistic attacks (e.g., eavesdropping, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, and playback). Students will also learn important internet security services such as secure emails, secure transport (SSL/TLS), secure network (IPsec), and virtual private network (VPN). Cohort classes give active learning opportunities for students to apply their knowledge in problem solving under the instructorâ€™s guidance. Students will also have a chance to apply OS shell and C/Java software tools towards analysing and implementing secure internet software. IT professionals (e.g., engineers, managers, consultants) will gain a broad and practical understanding of major security threats in the internet and corresponding defenses against them. They will also acquire skills to conceptualize, design, and implement secure network applications.
