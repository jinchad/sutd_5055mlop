### Overview

In this course, we will introduce concepts of quantum computing to participants. This will include the principles of quantum physics, and their application to computing. Participants will learn how quantum effects can be used to design logic gates. Participants will gain an appreciation of how quantum differs from classic gates and how they can be used in quantum algorithms. They will have a firsthand experience in implementing quantum logic gates (using IBM Q circuit composer and Qiskit).

We will discuss how these quantum algorithms differ from those supported by classical computers. We will discover how these techniques can be applied in optimisation problems, and cryptography domains.

##### **Learning outcomes**

By the end of this course, participants should be able to / can expect to:

1. Have a basic understanding of quantum physics and how they are used in quantum computing.
2. Learn how a quantum gate differ from classical logic gate.
3. Learn about various quantum gates (E.g. Hadamard, Pauli gates, Controlled NOT etc).
4. Compose simple scores on IBM Q and observe their computational results.
5. Appreciate how these gates can lead to the development of quantum algorithms.
6. Apply quantum algorithms to solve optimisation and cryptographic problems.
