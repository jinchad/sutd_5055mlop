I_wish_to_submit_a_student-initiated_workshop_prop



I wish to submit a student-initiated workshop proposal. When is the deadline for submission?
============================================================================================

There is no deadline for student-initiated workshop proposal submissions as we accept proposals all year round. You have to look for a faculty/staff advisor to acknowledge the proposal. Incomplete submissions will not processed. Send in early for review in time for your activity as student proposals may take up to 2 weeks for review.
