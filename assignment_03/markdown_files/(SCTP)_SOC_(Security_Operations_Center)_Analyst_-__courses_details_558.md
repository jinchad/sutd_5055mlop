SOC Analyst program offers practical and theoretical cyber incident analysis and response knowledge.  
More and more organizations are implementing managed security services internally and using MSSPs. Properly trained SOC Analysts give businesses solid cyber defense, fix damages and save costs. SOC Analysts are a critical part of damage mitigation activities, working on the front line of responding to cyber-attacks and incidents. SOC Analysts know how to react efficiently and effectively to security threats and incidents.  
Trainees of this program will gain the practical knowledge required for their career in CS while learning the art and science of cybersecurity operations, from the vocabulary and effectiveness of incident handling to the severity of incidents and prioritization.

The **SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme (SCTP)** supports mid-career individuals in acquiring industry-relevant skills to improve employability and pivot to new sectors or job roles. It is a train-and-place programme that is available on a part-time or full-time format, ranging from three to 12 months.

Similar to existing requirements for other training grants administered by SSG, **trainees must fulfill minimum attendance requirements and pass the assessments to qualify for course fee subsidies. Trainees who are unable to meet these requirements, or exit the programme without a valid reason, may be asked to return the course fee subsidy that they have received, including any additional course fee funding support.** Under the SCTP scheme, trainees are encouraged to complete all modules to fully benefit from the intent of the programme.
