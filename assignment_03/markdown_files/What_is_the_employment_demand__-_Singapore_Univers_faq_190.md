What is the employment demand?
==============================

There is currently an acute shortage of AI talents i.e., engineers and product managers who can combine technical expertise in design innovation with the skills to apply AI to other disciplines (such as engineering, healthcare, media, built environment, etc.). This includes AI for making UI design smarter, automating content creation, curation and management including creating abstracts and graphic objects, personalising UX, etc.




Given this, and the anticipated 10,000 tech-related jobs to be created in the next few years through Digital Industry Singapore (DISG), we believe that there will be a very strong demand for AI talents who are well-trained in user experience design, software programming, hardware design, IoT integration to formulate personalised solutions that meet the needs of that industry sector, and society in general.
