Overview
========

Digital cameras today are modeled after the human eye. They capture color information based only on three color filters, i.e. red, green and blue (R,G,B). With increasing advances in imagers and sensors, more detailed color information in the form of multispectral detectors are being developed to address specific needs in various industries. As color perception is one of the most quantifiable of human senses, this course aims to provide a foundational understanding of colors and how colors are generated, measured and quantified.
