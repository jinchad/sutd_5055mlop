When would I be receiving matriculation details, including information on laptop requirements/ purchases etc?
=============================================================================================================

The Office of Student Administration (OSA) will be sending out an Online Matriculation Exercise (OMEx) guide when you are informed to start OMEx:



* in Dec (for returning NSmen who would like to matriculate earlier in January of your intake year); or
* in June (for other students matriculating in the same year).


This guide details the administrative procedures and required documents to complete the online matriculation.  
  
Subsequently in August, OSA will send out a Freshmen Guide to provide more information about matriculation and start of term in September. Laptop promotional deals will also be released in August.  
  
You may contact the Office of Student Administration at [studentadmin@sutd.edu.sg](mailto:studentadmin@sutd.edu.sg) or 6499 4060 if you have specific queries relating to the procedures, forms, etc.
