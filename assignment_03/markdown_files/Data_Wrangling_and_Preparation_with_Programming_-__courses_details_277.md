### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science](/course/ModularMaster-in-Data-Science "ModularMasters in Data Science") (Programming Track) programme**

In computer science particularly, you may have heard of the phrase “Garbage in, garbage out”; and that’s true for data analysis, the importance of having quality and the right data format is critical to any data science project. Data wrangling is the function of transforming raw data into data that is usable down the data science process.

This course is designed to introduce the general concepts of Data Science with a focus on Data Wrangling for participants who prefer a programming approach. By the end of this course, participants will be able to wrangle data and prepare the dataset ready for Machine Learning Model.

##### **Plan your learning path**

This course can be taken as a module on its own or as part of the **[Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics (Programming)](/course/Graduate-Certificate-Data-Science "Learn more")** stack and participants will earn 12 subject credits which can also be used towards completing the **[ModularMaster in Data Science](/course/ModularMaster-in-Data-Science "Learn more")**.

##### **Course details**

1. **Course dates:** (25) March, (1, 8, 15, 22) April, and (6) May 2025  
   Registration closed.
2. **Course dates:** (27) October, (3, 10, 17, 24) November, and (1) December 2025  
   **Registration closes:** 3 October 2025

##### **Who should attend**

* Participants in roles which require hands-on preparation of data with programming
* Aspiring data/business analysts or data scientists looking to acquire skills in the data preparation and wrangling component
* Ideal for participants who are in or looking to acquire skills for roles such as entry-level Data Engineers/Data Analysts

**Prerequisites**

* Participants should preferably have passed mathematics at least ‘O’ Level or equivalent.
* Participants should be conversant with basic IT skills such as software installation, file management and web navigation.
* Participants are encouraged to complete the Foundation of Data Science before enrolling in this course.
* Participants are required to pass a pre-course assessment to ensure participants have the requisite knowledge of Python programming. This assessment can be waived if participants have completed both Fundamentals in Python (Basic) and Fundamentals in Python (Intermediate).
* Participants are required to bring their laptops.
