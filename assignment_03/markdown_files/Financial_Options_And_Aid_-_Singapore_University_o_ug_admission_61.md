SUTD believes that no deserving student should be denied an SUTD education because of financial difficulty. As such, we strive to help eligible students tap on all available financial aid and financial support resources to help fund their tertiary education and/or living allowances.

Based on eligibility, a customised combination of the following schemes will make up the financial support package for the individual student.
