### Message from programme directors

Welcome to the SUTD Technology Entrepreneurship Programme (STEP). Our programme is designed to provide you with a unique and innovative curriculum that integrates mastery of a specialised technological field with entrepreneurship acumen.

Spanning 10 academic terms, STEP provides a design-centric education with a strong foundation in technology, design and entrepreneurship. The journey culminates in a Master of Science (MSc) project in Technology Entrepreneurship in the final year.

Throughout the programme, you will have the opportunity to immerse yourself in entrepreneurial cultures and environment across different countries and continents. You will undertake a work immersion, and take management and entrepreneurship courses at our partner universities overseas. Our partnerships with esteemed institutions such as University of California Berkeley Extension, Aalto University, Zhejiang University, and Xi’an Jiaotong University will offer you a diverse and enriching experience.

As a STEP graduate, you will be prepared to pursue careers in technology start-ups, become “intrapreneur” within large corporations, or realise your dream of starting your own tech business.

We are confident that STEP will equip you with the skills and knowledge needed to become the entrepreneurial leaders and innovators of tomorrow. Embrace this opportunity for global exposure, and let your passion for technology and entrepreneurship thrive!

Sincerely,
