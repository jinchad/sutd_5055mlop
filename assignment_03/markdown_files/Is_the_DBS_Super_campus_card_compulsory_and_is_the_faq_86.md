Is the DBS Super campus card compulsory and is there any annual fee?
====================================================================

Yes, the card is compulsory for SUTD students. It is an all-in-one card that acts as your SUTD Student Identification card, Campus Access card, Visa Debit card, ATM card, NETS card and EZ-Link card. There are no annual fees for the DBS SUTD Visa Debit Card.



* Students are required to have an existing DBS Bank Account before applying for the campus card. You may choose not to activate the ATM function upon receiving the debit card.
* This card **does not** include concessionary rates for public transport. You are advised to apply for the **Tertiary Student EZ-Link Concession card** from TransitLink separately to enjoy the concession rate. **The university will provide more information on the Tertiary Student EZ-Link Concession card application period at a later date.**
