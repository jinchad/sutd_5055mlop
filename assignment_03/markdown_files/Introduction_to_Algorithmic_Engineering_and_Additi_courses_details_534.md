Overview
========

This course aims to equip learners with the fundamental skills to using algorithmic engineering to develop designs and using desktop resin 3D-printer for rapid prototyping.

Hyperganic Core is the development platform for Algorithmic Engineering.  
It is a software engine that empowers us to build object generation workflows using algorithms rather than a Graphic User Interface (GUI). This gives us full design freedom and complexity in designing cross-industry application solutions for objects with significantly more efficient prototype iteration timelines.

Additionally, learners will be exposed to the workflow for stereolithography (SLA) 3D Printing, from Slicing to Post-processing. Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing is a relatively low cost Additive Manufacturing technology that generates functional parts with great finishing, depending on the material and setting of the print.

Combining both skills, learners will be equipped with the fundamental skills in Hyperganic and stereolithography (SLA) Additive Manufacturing. These skill sets are valuable in industrial application, especially in low volume production, Research & Development, and optimized Design for Additive Manufacturing.
