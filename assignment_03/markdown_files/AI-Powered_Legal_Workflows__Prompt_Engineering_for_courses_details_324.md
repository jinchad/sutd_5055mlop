### Overview

AI-Powered Legal Workflows: Prompt Engineering for Contracts and Compliance is a specialised programme designed to introduce legal executives and para-legal workers to foundation models and prompt engineering concepts. The course aims to demonstrate how Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) can revolutionise legal workflows and tasks through AI assistants. Participants will gain a deep understanding of the mechanisms and capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and learn to use prompt engineering effectively to enhance productivity and efficiency.

This course includes a detailed exploration of LLMs’ abilities to perform tasks like summarisation, classification, and extraction, simplifying various aspects of legal work.

The course will present numerous use cases and offer hands-on exercises to use Generative AI effectively for legal work. No programming experience or prior knowledge of Generative AI is required.
