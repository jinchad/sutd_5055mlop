I did poorly for my A-Level exams. How can I increase my chances of admission into SUTD?

There are various alternative pathways for you to consider, including:



* Retaking your A-Levels; or
* Further your studies via the polytechnics, which offer module exemptions of up to two semesters for A-Level graduates in selected courses. These module exemptions allow A-Level graduates to graduate with a polytechnic diploma within 2 or 2.5 years, compared to the usual 3 years. More information on the application process and courses on offer can be found on the respective polytechnicsâ€™ websites
