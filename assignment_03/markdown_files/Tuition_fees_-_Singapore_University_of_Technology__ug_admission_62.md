### Tuition fees

SUTD aims to redefine design, education and research, and draw on multiple disciplines to make a positive impact on society. To realise this vision, we admit talented promising students and provide financial support based on merit and need.

Tuition fees at SUTD are highly subsidised by the Singapore Government. This substantial subsidy comes in the form of a tuition grant administered by the Singapore Government that allows eligible students to pay subsidised tuition fees.

### Tuition Grant




The MOE Tuition Grant is a grant provided by the Government of Singapore to help students manage the costs of full-time tertiary education in Singapore. Eligible Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and international students enrolled in full-time undergraduate courses at the autonomous universities may receive it.  
  
Eligible **Singapore Citizens** are automatically awarded a Tier A Tuition Grant, which is the highest level of tuition fee subsidy, when you commence your studies. Singapore Citizens thus pay the lowest tuition fees. There is no bond obligation.  
  
Eligible **Permanent Residents** may choose to apply for a Tier B Tuition Grant only. Successful applicants are required to work for a Singapore entity for three years upon graduation.  
  
Eligible **international students** may choose to apply for a Tier C Tuition Grant only. There is a limited number of Tuition Grants available for international students, and selection is competitive and based on merit. Successful applicants are required to work for a Singapore entity for three years upon graduation.  
  
If you do not apply for a Tuition Grant, or if you do not complete the registration and signing process, you will need to pay non-subsidised fees.
