### Overview

##### **Innovation through Creativity**

**So you’ve heard of Design Thinking. What’s Design Innovation then?**

Design Innovation (DI) is a design process that is user-centric and begins with execution of specific design methods. These methods guide activities that lead to desired outcomes. This 1-day workshop will introduce participants to design thinking and its contribution to innovation and value creation, and make extensive use of hands-on exercises to train design innovation methods.

Learn advanced design and engineering methods in a way that both experienced and novice designers can benefit from. Through hands-on experience, you will gain awareness and confidence of the DI process.
