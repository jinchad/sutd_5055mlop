### Overview

##### **Modelling your career**

**Data-driven**. Now that’s a word you would have heard umpteen times and no wonder because the environments we work in are starting to look a lot like they are. From what to watch next on Netflix, to dynamic ticket pricing on airlines, organisations and businesses are using data-driven approaches to improve efficiencies and make critical decisions.

The **SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme (SCTP)** supports mid-career individuals in acquiring industry-relevant skills to improve employability and pivot to new sectors or job roles. It is a train-and-place programme that is available on a part-time or full-time format, ranging from three to 12 months.  
  
Similar to existing requirements for other training grants administered by SSG, **trainees must fulfill minimum attendance requirements and pass the assessments to qualify for course fee subsidies. Trainees who are unable to meet these requirements, or exit the programme without a valid reason, may be asked to return the course fee subsidy that they have received, including any additional course fee funding support.** Under the SCTP scheme, trainees are encouraged to complete all modules to fully benefit from the intent of the programme.  
  
For more information, please refer to the **[FAQs on SCTP](/repo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/FAQs-for-SCTP-Public-V01-1.pdf)**or the**[SkillsFuture website](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/sctp)**.

##### **Who should attend?**

We encourage anyone to join us for this exciting programme. And by anyone, we mean anyone – anyone who is generally curious with a great interest in finding out what data is, to making data magic through analysis and predictions. Whether it is exploring roles in data science for absolute beginners or career-switchers who are exploring additional skillset in data, across major industries, data is in demand in the age of Smart Nation.

##### **How does it work?**

For the ModularMaster pathway, learners can mix and stack modules the way that best fit their learning goals as long as they add up to **72 subject credits** within **2 years within the same domain**.

If you have not decided on pursuing the ModularMaster, you can always take up individual modules that are the most relevant to your learning goals.
