What is ESD about?
==================

The study of engineering systems concerns the design, planning, and operations of large scale complex systems. Examples of engineering systems include transportation systems, supply chain and logistics, defence systems, energy systems, financial services and healthcare systems.

The ESD undergraduate degree delivers a programme that is broad, with opportunities for acquiring in-depth knowledge in specific application areas. The ESD core consists of rigorous methodology courses, which provide the technical foundation necessary to design, analyse, and optimise systems. Students supplement this core by choosing from a variety of elective courses depending on their interests. They may also specialise in specialisation track(s) by choosing the elective courses related to the track.
