### Overview

Front-end development, also known as client-side development is the process of producing web applications which users interface and interact with directly. Front-end developers typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as an array of frameworks to build applications that we use daily. Front-end development learners can find employment as web designers, UI/UX designers, or full-blown front-end developers.
