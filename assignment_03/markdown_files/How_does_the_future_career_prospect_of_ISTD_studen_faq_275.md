====================================================================================================

Traditional Computer Science Graduates have a deep technical background, excelling in programming and theoretical computing. They are well-suited for roles requiring deep technical expertise but may lack exposure to broader design or business integration. ISTD Graduates combine computer science, technology design, and interdisciplinary problem-solving to create innovative, user-centric products and systems. They are highly adaptable and can fit into various roles that require both technical knowledge and business or design insight. Traditional Information Systems Graduates bridge the gap between technology and business, focusing on implementing and managing IT solutions within organizational settings. They are well-equipped for roles that require aligning technology to business processes and improving operational efficiency.
