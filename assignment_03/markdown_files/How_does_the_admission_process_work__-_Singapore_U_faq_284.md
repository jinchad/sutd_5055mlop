How does the admission process work?
====================================

The MSSD Graduate Committee will screen all applications. Selected candidates will be invited for an interview with members of the committee.



Recommendations by the committee will be forwarded to the Head of the ISTD pillar who, in concert with Office of the Graduate School, will decide on a final list of applicants to be offered admission into the MSSD program.
