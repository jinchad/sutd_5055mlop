### Overview

The course is an introduction to classical Machine Learning technique using Python and Scikit-Learn. It introduces learners to basic machine learning steps from data preparation to evaluation of machine learning models. Learners will learn and build two classical machine learning models namely Linear Regression and Logistic Regression for continuous and categorical data respectively. Learners will learn how to process data using R-squared  Pandas library in Python as well as to visualize those data using Seaborn and Matplotlib. At the end, they will learn some metrics to evaluate their machine learning models.
