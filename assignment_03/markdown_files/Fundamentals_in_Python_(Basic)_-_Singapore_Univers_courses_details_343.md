### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science](/course/ModularMaster-in-Data-Science "ModularMasters in Data Science") programme**

Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasises code readability, and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.

A firm grasp of Python will be useful for individuals who want to advance into the fields of **Data Science** and/or **Artificial Intelligence**, giving them an edge when they do take up such courses in the future.

You will be equipped with the basic skillset in programming to progress on to the intermediate level.  
This course is designed to introduce the general concepts of programming to anyone, regardless of their computing or math background.

By the end of this course, participants will be able to leverage programming to customise tasks or break down large tasks into granular tasks or aggregate various steps into a single step effectively.

##### **Course details**

**Course dates:** (31) Jul, (7, 14, 21, 18) Aug, (4) Sep 2025

**Registration closes:** 4 Jul 2025

5 days; 9.00AM – 5.00PM

##### **Who should attend**

Working professionals who are not in the fields of programming or data science/artificial intelligence and are interested to advance into the fields.

Employed persons who have been newly appointed to programming/data science/artificial intelligence roles or supporting roles (E.g. Systems analyst, applications developer, platform engineer, UI/UX designer, IT consulting analyst, quality analyst, IT auditor, system administrator, cloud engineer, etc)\*

\*Roles specified are referenced from SSG’s Skills Framework for Infocomm Technology.
