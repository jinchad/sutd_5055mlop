| **THIS BURSARY AWARD IS MADE POSSIBLE BY​ THE SILENT FOUNDATION**   The Silent Foundation was founded on 14 July 2010 by Mr Teng Ngiek Lian. It is a registered charity in Singapore.    Mr Teng was born in Terengganu, Malaysia. After completing his O levels at the age of 18, he left school and started work. In 1996, he fulfilled his dream to manage his own business and founded Target Asset Management. In 2010, at the age of 60, Mr Teng founded The Silent Foundation along with his son Matthew. He felt that he has benefited tremendously from the society all these years and it is his duty to pay back.    Funded by the Teng family, the Foundation today has an Endowment Capital Sum of S$50 million.    The foundation is named The Silent Foundation as it is dedicated to assist the ‘silent sufferers’. Silent sufferers refer to those who have been overlooked by the society and tend to be voiceless. The Silent Foundation focuses equally on two main areas. The first is marginalised individuals whose circumstances make it difficult for them to receive assistance from the mainstream channels. This would include migrant workers, minority races and women whose rights are not protected. The second area championed by The Silent Foundation is animals and the environment who also cannot speak out against suffering.    This philosophy parallels Mr Teng’s professional approach, as he practices value investing which focuses in the overlooked and unloved sectors. |
