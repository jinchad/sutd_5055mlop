Will the CDP require significant extra work?
============================================

Students in SHARP will have already fulfilled more than half of the requirements for an MEng from SUTD, provided they choose a cross-listed undergraduate and graduate course in Term 7 or 8. Within Terms 9 and 10, they will just need to take one graduate course, and extend their project to satisfy the criteria for an MEng thesis.
