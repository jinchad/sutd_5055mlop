30.114 Advanced Feedback and Control
====================================

Extending feedback control theory and applications (from 30.101 Systems & Control) to include multi-input & multi-output and discrete-time systems. Mathematical modeling and analysis of discrete time systems in various disciplines using state-space, pulse transfer function and z-transform. Relating controllability and observability and their canonical forms to synthesize and design advanced continuous and discrete-time controllers. Introduction of pole-placement based controller design and formulation of state observers.

##### **Goal**

The goal of this class is to build on understanding of linear time-invariant state space systems to synthesize and evaluate advanced feedback controllers as well as digital implementation of such controllers. It has wide applications including, mechatronics, robotics, automation, space technology, transportation & aviation, medical systems, financial markets and energy management.

##### **Learning objectives**

* Represent physical systems in continuous state-space canonical forms and solve the linear time-invariant (LTI) state equation.
* Assess the controllability and observability of LTI state-space continuous-time and discrete-time systems for stability analysis, design of controllers and regulators with specific dynamic performances.
* Extend modelling principles to describe discrete-time systems and represent them using pulse transfer functions and state-space.
* Analyze and synthesize discrete time control systems using the z transform and root locus.
* Convert a continuous time system to a discrete-time system and vice-versa.

##### **Measurable outcomes**

* Given a physical system, conceive a set differential equations and difference equations describing continuous and discrete-time model of the system and representing it state-space. [LO1, LO3]
* Describe the notion of controllability and observability for both continuous and discrete-time systems and design full and reduced-order state observers and state feedback and integral controllers [LO2].
* Apply Eigenvalue analysis to determine poles and subsequent stability of state-space system. [LO2]
* Based on a performance specification, design a suitable digital compensator for a discrete-time system using z-transform and on the z-plane using root-locus analysis. [LO2]
* Model and represent discrete time signals and systems using the z Transform and solve LTI difference equation and the systems that these equations describe using the inverse z transform and the z plane. [LO4]
* With a system described in a continuous-time representation, express the corresponding system in a discrete-time representation and be able to map between the s-plane of continuous systems to z-plane of discrete-time systems. [LO5]
