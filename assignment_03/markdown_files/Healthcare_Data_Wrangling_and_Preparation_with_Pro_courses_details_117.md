Overview
========

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science (Healthcare)](/course/modularmaster-in-data-science-healthcare/ "ModularMasters in Data Science") programme**

Data Wrangling and Preparation course provides a comprehensive understanding of the critical stages involved in preparing data for analysis, from sourcing and collection to transformation and cleaning. By mastering the techniques and tools involved in data wrangling, professionals can address data inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, ensuring data quality and integrity. This process enables them to transform raw, unstructured data into a clean and usable format, making it ready for exploration and analysis. Effective data wrangling and preparation not only save time and effort during the analysis phase but also lay the groundwork for accurate and reliable insights. It allows data professionals to unlock the true potential of datasets, extract meaningful information, and make informed decisions that drive business success.

This course, spanning a duration of five days, is specifically designed to equip participants with comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in manipulating and preparing healthcare data for analysis. Over the course of the first four days, participants will learn various techniques to transform and clean healthcare data into a suitable format, addressing data quality issues, and employing effective data cleaning techniques. Participants will acquire expertise in data manipulation, including handling missing values, detecting outliers, and ensuring data consistency within the healthcare domain. They will learn practical methods to cleanse and preprocess healthcare data, ensuring it is well-prepared for further analysis. Participants will be actively involved in a healthcare-related project throughout the module. The final day, which is split into two half-days on separate weeks, will be dedicated to project consultation and project presentation. By the end of the course, participants will have a solid understanding of data wrangling principles and techniques, enabling them to adeptly tackle complex data challenges and effectively prepare datasets for analysis within the healthcare field.
