| Prima Limited was founded in 1961 as the first flour mill in S.E. Asia. The inauguration of Prima transformed the industry for Singapore and the region as it heralded the beginning of locally milled flour replacing imported flour. Our success provided the impetus for other countries in the region to establish their own flour mills.   From a modest flour miller, Prima has grown steadily to become an international industrial group. Operating in three strategic manufacturing hubs in Singapore, China and Sri Lanka, the Prima Group’s business today include flour milling, feed milling, food manufacturing, foodservice, F&B franchising, bakery equipment and systems, baking and culinary education, information technology, R&D services, trading and investments.    With annual turnover of over S$1 billion, the Prima Group employs about 4,000 people.    Prima’s stability and longstanding success are underpinned by the “3H” Corporate Philosophy laid down by its late founder Mr Cheng Tsang Man, which is:     * Building a Healthy organization * Being an Honourable winner, and * Making an Honest fortune |
