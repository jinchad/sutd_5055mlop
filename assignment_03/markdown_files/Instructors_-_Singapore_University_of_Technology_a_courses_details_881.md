#### **Shubhakar Kalya**

Lecturer, SMT  
SUTD

Currently working as a Lecturer at Singapore University of Technology and Design, Shubhakar obtained his Master’s degree in Microelectronics from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, India in 2007 and PhD degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore in 2012/13.

During his doctoral studies at NTU, he worked on Nanoscale characterisation of High-κ gate dielectrics for reliability and failure analysis. He has also worked as a researcher at Institute of Materials and Research Engineering (IMRE), Singapore, from July 2009 to December 2011, where he was involved in research related to characterisation of High-κ gate dielectrics using scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. His research interests are in nanoscale characterisation and analysis of High-κ gate dielectrics for logic and memory devices, and failure analysis of nanoscale electronic devices. He was a Visiting Scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, USA in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Department during January-June 2017.

#### **Nagarajan Raghavan**

Associate Professor, EPD, Co-Director, NEED Programme  
SUTD

Nagarajan is a tenured Associate Professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in the Engineering Product Development (EPD) pillar. He is also the Co-Director of the Nano-Electronic Engineering and Design (NEED) double master’s degree programme. He has been a faculty at SUTD since 2015. Prior to that, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge and at IMEC in Belgium, in joint association with the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KUL). He obtained his PhD (Microelectronics, 2012) at the Division of Microelectronics, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

His work focuses on reliability modelling of nanoelectronic devices (especially logic and non-volatile memory device technologies), prognostics and health management for batteries and LEDs, design for reliability, physics of failure, AI-enabled optimisation of electromechanical properties of polymer nanocomposites and AI-enabled design for additive manufacturing. He is the recipient of the SUTD Outstanding Researcher Award for 2022, IEEE EDS Early Career Award for 2016, Asia-Pacific recipient for the IEEE EDS PhD Student Fellowship in 2011 and the IEEE Reliability Society Graduate Scholarship Award in 2008. To-date, he has authored / co-authored more than 270 international peer-reviewed publications with 4300+ citations and a h-index of 31 and five invited book chapters as well. He served as the General Chair for IEEE IPFA 2021 at Singapore and has consistently served on the review committee for various IEEE journals and conferences including IRPS, IIRW, IPFA and ESREF. He is an Associate Editor of the IEEE Access and Microelectronic Engineering journals and sits in the Editorial Advisory Board for APL Machine Learning. He is currently a Member of IEEE (2005-present) and was an invited member of the IEEE GOLD committee (2012-2014).
