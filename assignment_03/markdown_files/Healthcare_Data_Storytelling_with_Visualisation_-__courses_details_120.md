### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science (Healthcare)](/course/modularmaster-in-data-science-healthcare/ "ModularMasters in Data Science") programme**

Data Storytelling and Visualization provide a crucial framework for effective communication and insightful interpretation of data. Proficiency in these areas allows data professionals to transform complex datasets into compelling narratives and visually engaging representations. By mastering the art of data storytelling, professionals learn to effectively convey insights, patterns, and trends to various audiences, enabling informed decision-making. Through visualization techniques and tools, they can create intuitive graphics and interactive dashboards that facilitate understanding and exploration of data. Additionally, data professionals develop a deep understanding of design principles to enhance the impact and clarity of their visualisations. In data science, it is important to combine analytical prowess with compelling storytelling to unlock the true potential of data and communicate its value in a meaningful and impactful way.

This course, spanning a duration of five days, is specifically designed to equip participants with data storytelling and visualisation skills in heathcare context. Over the first four days, participants will acquire the ability to identify patterns and trends, as well as deliver improved data presentation through visuals, utilizing various data visualisation tools. By focusing on contextualised healthcare case studies, participants will develop an appreciation for how data visualisation has bolstered decision support within the healthcare field. Participants will be actively involved in a healthcare-related project throughout the module. The final day, which is split into two half-days on separate weeks, will be dedicated to project consultation and project presentation.
