### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science (Healthcare)](/course/modularmaster-in-data-science-healthcare/ "ModularMasters in Data Science") programme**

Data Science Modeling is a fundamental component of the data science workflow, encompassing a wide range of techniques and algorithms used to extract insights and make predictions from data. It involves the understanding and application of mathematical and statistical models to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends in complex datasets. Data professionals utilize various modeling approaches, such as supervised learning and unsupervised learning, depending on the nature of the problem and the available data. Through model selection, training, and evaluation, they aim to create accurate and robust models that generalize well to unseen data. Data science modeling plays a crucial role in diverse applications, including but not limited to predictive analytics, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and image recognition. By leveraging the power of modeling techniques, data professionals can harness the value of data and derive actionable insights, ultimately driving informed decision-making and generating positive impact across industries.

This course, spanning a duration of five days, is specifically designed to equips participants with skills on basic supervised and unsupervised machine learning models in healthcare settings. Participants will learn to leverage these models appropriately and evaluate various parameters based on the consequences of the predicted model. The course aims to equip individuals with the necessary skills to apply machine learning techniques in healthcare scenarios. Over the first four days, participants will gain insights into the selection and implementation of machine learning models, considering their potential impacts in healthcare decision-making. Participants will be actively involved in a healthcare-related project throughout the module. The final day, which is split into two half-days on separate weeks, will be dedicated to project consultation and project presentation.
