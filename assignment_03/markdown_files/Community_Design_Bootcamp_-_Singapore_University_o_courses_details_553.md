### Overview

The Community Design Bootcamp aims to empower and equip residents from public housing neighbourhoods to propose, design, develop, and implement creative solutions to create friendly and lively community spaces in their living environment. Throughout the course, the participants will be exposed to skill and knowledge in creating a community-centric design through the approach of participatory planning, as well as methods to translate ideas into real life community design projects.

The course will be conducted in mixed methods including lecture and a range of hands-on, collaborative activities, where participants can learn about design thinking and its application to develop their community design projects. The ultimate goal of the community design projects is meant to create neighbourhood community spaces that encourage community bonding, enhance neighbourhood identity, and exemplify care for neighbours.
