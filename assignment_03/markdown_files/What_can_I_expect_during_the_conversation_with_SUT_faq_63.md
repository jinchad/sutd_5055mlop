What can I expect during the conversation with SUTD faculty/leader? How important is this in determining my chance of securing an admission placement?
======================================================================================================================================================

The conversation with our faculty/leader is an important one as it will provide you with the opportunity to ask any questions you may have about SUTD. It will also help us to understand your motivation for applying to the University, get to know you better and discuss whether SUTD is a good fit for you. If you are selected for our Special Programmes, you will be invited for a special selection exercise which also includes a conversation with our faculty/leader. You will be notified of the details via email once you are selected.




For scholarships, we will be looking out for outstanding achievements in both your academic and co-curricular activities, as well as your service and desire to help the community â€“ which may set you apart from the competition.




Based on the conversation as well as your application profile, our faculty/leader will provide an assessment which will be fully reviewed by the Admissions Selection Committee, who will make the final decision on your admission placement and/or scholarship.
