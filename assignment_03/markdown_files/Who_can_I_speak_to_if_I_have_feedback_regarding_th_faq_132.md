Who can I speak to if I have feedback regarding the internship?
===============================================================

Members of the Career Development Centre will conduct at least one visit to your company in the course of your internship. During which, they will arrange for an opportunity to speak with you personally, as well as your supervisor and the relevant HR personnel. The visit will function as a general feedback session regarding the internship. Should you have pressing issues that require voicing out urgently, please drop us an e-mail at careers@sutd.edu.sg.
