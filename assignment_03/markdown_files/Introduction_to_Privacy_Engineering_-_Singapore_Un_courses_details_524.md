### Overview

Digital economy runs on data. Technology is getting more powerful, ubiquitous and invasive. The frequency and scale of data breaches and cybersecurity incidents have been on the rise. Worse, there are practices that organisations have violated the privacy of the individuals whose data they have collected and used.

Privacy engineering is an emerging discipline which aims to ensure that privacy principles, frameworks, methodologies and techniques are properly and systematically embedded into products and systems. With a disciplined and structured approach to privacy in technology deployment and products design, robust protection on personal data and privacy will emerge.
