I have been accepted into the SUTD Honours and Research Programme (SHARP), and received a scholarship from an external organisation. Can i still enroll in this programme?

You can still enroll in this programme. However, you are not allowed to hold more than one scholarship. You will have to decide which scholarship to accept. Please inform SUTD of your final decision.
