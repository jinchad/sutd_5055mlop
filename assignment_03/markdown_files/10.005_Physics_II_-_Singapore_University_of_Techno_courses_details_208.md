10.005 Physics II
=================

This course is the typical first year Electromagnetism course for engineering students, based on a similar course offered at MIT. The materials include Electrostatics: electric charge, Coulomb’s law, electrostatic field, Gauss’ Law, electric potential difference, electrostatic energy; electric structure of matter: conductors, capacitors, and dielectrics; electric current: current, resistance, Ohm’s Law, and DC circuit theory with capacitors; magnetostatics: magnetic field, Lorentz Force Law, Biot-Savart Law, and Ampere’s law; magnetic properties of materials; time-varying fields: electromotive force, Faraday’s law of induction, inductors, energy stored in magnetic field; Maxwell’s equations: displacement current, Poynting vector, and conservation of energy; electromagnetic waves: plane, standing and travelling conditions.



##### **Learning Objectives**



At the end of the term, students will be able to:



* Know Coulomb’s and Gauss’ law and apply them in simple geometries
* Have an understanding of and apply, in simple circuits, Kirchoff’s and Ohm’s law
* Explain the generation of magnetic fields from currents using Ampere’s law and the Biot-Savartlaw
* Explain the concept of inductance
* Have an familiarity with Maxwell’s equations
* Calculate the Poynting vector and explain how it relates to the flow of electromagnetic energy
* Be familiar with Snell’s law, polarisation, interference and diffraction of light
