I donâ€™t know which programme I should join.
===========================================

Generally, if you are passionate about addressing social inequality, you can join the Create4Good Innovation Fund. Should you have any other ideas, you can check out ARISE or the Entrepreneurship Capstone for final year students. Start Something is a good introductory programme if you are still unsure of what you want to do.
