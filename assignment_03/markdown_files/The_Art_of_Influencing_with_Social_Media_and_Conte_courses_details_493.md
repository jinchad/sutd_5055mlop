Overview
========

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Strategic Digital Marketing](/repo/course/modularmaster-in-strategic-digital-marketing/ "ModularMasters in Strategic Digital Marketing") programme**




Businesses know how important **Social Media** can be for their business but how would they decide on a social media platform and for what purpose? Is their planned budget sufficient? How do they measure success and plan for further optimisation?

This 5-day programme addresses these gaps and provides learners with the confidence to know how to be effective in dealing with their own teams and/or an agency/vendor in the analysis, planning, implementation and measurement of an effective social media strategy. This programme is designed by industry practitioners and aims to equip marketers with the latest knowledge and best practices in **social media** including **Influencer Marketing**, **Content Creation** and **Paid Social Media advertising**.

This is an extremely practical course as individuals/teams will have to deliver a plan that will be graded and this plan can be used as a blueprint for their own organisation’s social media marketing plan.

##### **Plan your learning path**

This course can be taken as a module on its own or as part of the **[Graduate Certificate in Social Media Marketing](/repo/course/graduate-certificate-digital-marketing/ "Learn more")** stack and participants will earn 12 subject credits which can also be used towards completing the **[ModularMaster in Strategic Digital Marketing](/repo/course/modularmaster-in-strategic-digital-marketing/ "Learn more")**.

##### **Course Details**
