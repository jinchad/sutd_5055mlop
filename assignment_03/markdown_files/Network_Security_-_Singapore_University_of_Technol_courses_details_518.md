### Overview

This course covers the basis of symmetric key and public key cryptography and cryptographic hash functions. It applies the cryptographic techniques in the design of internet protocols that achieve crucial security properties of confidentiality, authenticity, and message integrity, against powerful but realistic eavesdropping, impersonation, man-in-the-middle and playback attacks.

Participants will learn important internet security services such as secure emails, secure transport (SSL/TLS) and virtual private network (VPN). Participants will also have a chance to apply C/Java software tools/modules towards implementing secure internet software.

IT professionals, engineers, or technical managers will gain a broad and practical understanding of major security threats in the internet and corresponding defenses against these threats. They will also acquire skills to conceptualise, design, and implement secure network applications.
