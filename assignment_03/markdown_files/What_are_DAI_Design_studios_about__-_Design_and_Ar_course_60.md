What are DAI Design studios about?
==================================

DAI has four design studios where students have diverse exposure to industry sectors and hands-on experience working on real-world data via company-sponsored projects. You will have the opportunity to engage directly with industries to look at problems, ask the right questions, collect data to analyse and come up with design solutions using AI. You will be exposed to not just AI tools and methodologies but other complementary tools as well.





[Product Design Studio](/course/60-003-product-design-studio)



In Product Design Studio, students will form teams to respond to a “Product Design Challenge” by developing, testing, and presenting a new product or business idea. Students will be introduced to a stage-based design process and be given opportunities to develop their skills in understanding user needs, ideating solutions and making prototypes through experiential learning.



Example Projects:



* Unmanned vehicle with sensors and AI for collision avoidance in a warehouse.
* An urban farming unit that changes farming conditions based on real-time data.


[Service Design Studio](/course/60-004-service-design-studio)



In Service Design Studio, students will form a team to respond to a “Service Design Challenge” by conceptualizing, designing, and implementing a new AI-based application to deliver a service. Students will learn web technologies to deploy cross-platform service solutions to various industry needs. The course is offered as a project-based course and managed in a tripartite collaboration involving SUTD, a Technology Expert company, and industries.



Example Projects:



* A chatbot that listens to a patient’s symptoms and health concerns, then guides the patient to the correct care based on its diagnosis.
* An application that analyses unstructured medical data (radiology images, blood tests, EKGs, genomics, patient medical history) to give doctors better insight into a patient’s real-time needs.


[Systems Design Studio](/course/60-008-systems-design-studio)



In Systems Design Studio, students will form a team to respond to a “Systems Design Challenge” by exploring the application of AI-enabled tools in large scale complex systems. Students will be introduced to planning, optimizing and management of organizational systems through simulation models.



Example Projects:



* Simulate a system of elevators – What are the best strategies to operate the elevators and minimize average waiting times.
* Simulate a delivery system – Analyse trade-offs between number of drivers; demand; average waiting time; number of orders cancelled; etc.
* Analyse the number of beds in a hospital, number of doctors and nurses, waiting room capacities, pharmaceutical inventories, etc. required during a pandemic.


[Spatial Design Studio](/course/60-006-spatial-design-studio)



Students will be conceptualizing and designing applications for the sustainable well-being and smart augmentation of an existing built environment, ranging from cities to building interiors.



Students will get to learn and apply AI-driven techniques in areas such as geospatial data analytics, building information modelling and ambient intelligent interaction.



Example Projects



* An AI application for designing adaptive spatial segregation and differentiated routing to reduce nosocomial infections in hospitals (e.g. separating infected/symptomatic COVID-19 patients and those without).
* An AI application for real-time capturing, tracking, analysis and verifying of building works in construction sites by coupling digital twins and augmented reality (AR) technologies.
