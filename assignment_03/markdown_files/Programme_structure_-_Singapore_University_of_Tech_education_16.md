Programme structure
===================

The SUTD Technology Entrepreneurship Programme (STEP)is aimed at nurturing a new generation of entrepreneurial leaders and innovators exhibiting Leadership, Innovation, Venture-mindset, and Engineering (LIVE) values, coupled with a global perspective.

Conducted over 10 terms, students in this integrated programme will benefit from global exposure and have the opportunity to be immersed in the entrepreneurial culture and environment in different countries/continents, before finishing off with SUTD’s signature team-based Capstone and a Master of Science (MSc) project in Technology Entrepreneurship.

Our current partners include University of California Berkeley Extension, Zhejiang University School of Management and Xi’an Jiaotong University.

##### **GRADUATE WITH TWO DEGREES**

Students will graduate concurrently with two degrees from SUTD:

* A [**Bachelor of Engineering** or **Bachelor of Science**](/education/undergraduate/majors/) in one of our five majors; and

They will then return to complete their last 3 terms of studies and graduate with a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree.
