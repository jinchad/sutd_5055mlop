I_have_a_new_email_address_that_will_receive_the_P



I have a new email address that will receive the Purchase Order (PO) and the PO is still sent to the old email address, what should I do to redirect the PO to the new email address?
=====================================================================================================================================================================================

If you have never opened any Purchase Order (PO) from SUTD before or cannot see any POs from SUTD in your Ariba account, please contact SUTD via email (sutdprocurement@sutd.edu.sg) so that we can resend an Invitation Email to your new email address. This invitation email, when opened, will establish the trading relationship with SUTD.

If you can already view POs from SUTD in your Ariba account, you can proceed to update the Electronic Order Routing Email Address. Please refer to the [user guide on “How to Change Supplier Electronic Routing Email”](/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/How-to-Change-Supplier-Electronic-Routing-Email.pdf).

It is important to note that all email addresses maintained in the Electronic Order Routing must be valid and active. If there is at least one email address that is invalid and/or inactive, this may cause issues with the (1) sending of Goods Receipt, Service Entry Sheet to Supplier’s Ariba account, and (2) creation of invoice.
