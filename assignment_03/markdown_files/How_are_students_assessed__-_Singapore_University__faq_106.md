How are students assessed?
==========================

The grading may be based on a combination of homework, design projects (1D, 2D), class participation/activity, online quizzes, mid-term tests and final exams, with the weightages varying for different subjects.




Students are graded on a GPA of 5.0.Â To help ease your transition to the university, all four subjects taken in the first Freshmore term are not graded. From the 2019 cohort onwards, students can also choose an additional two subjects from Freshmore terms 2 and 3 to be ungraded.
