Energy Systems
==============

D-Lab: Energy offers a hands-on, project-based approach that engages students in understanding and addressing the applications of alternative energy technology in developing countries where compact, robust, low-cost systems for generating power are required. Projects may include micro-hydro, solar, or wind turbine generators along with theoretical analysis, design, prototype construction, evaluation, and implementation. Students will have the opportunity to travel to a developing country during spring break to identify and implement projects. Image Credit
