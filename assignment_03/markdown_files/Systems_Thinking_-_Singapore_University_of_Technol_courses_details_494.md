### Overview

##### **Discover what linear thinking won’t accomplish for your business.**

Systems thinking unlocks the potential to a more holistic way of managing your team, company and business. Understanding why an action that is seemingly trivial will produce an unwanted large effect is what you will walk away with at the end of the 2 day course.

This course differs from other systems thinking courses by focusing on real life abstractions starting at the policy level and how government decisions affect businesses to enterprise policies and their effect and finally the startup scene. Real life examples will be used as case studies to allow the participants to learn and experience systems thinking first hand.
