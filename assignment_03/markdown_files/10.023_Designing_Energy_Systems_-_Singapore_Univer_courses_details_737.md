10.023 Designing Energy Systems
===============================

### Course Description

This course teaches physical and design concepts in energy related products and systems, such as lighting, mobile phones, and photovoltaic systems. Students will apply reverse engineering, redesigning, data analysis, modelling and simulations to these systems. In this course, students will be required to synthesize innovative solutions to real world problems.

##### **Delivery Format**

5-0-7\*

##### **Learning Objectives**

At the end of the course, students should be able to:

1. Use physical laws and quantitative analysis to evaluate limitations and performance of heat management and energy transformation systems
2. Execute experimentation, reverse engineering, redesigning, and data analysis on energy-related products and energy systems
3. Modify and design energy-related products and photovoltaics systems using design principles, simulations and data-driven approaches
