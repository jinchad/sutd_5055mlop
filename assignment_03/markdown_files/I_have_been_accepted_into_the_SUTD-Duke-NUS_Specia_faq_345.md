I_have_been_accepted_into_the_SUTD-Duke-NUS_Specia



I have been accepted into the SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track but I do not wish to take up the scholarship/receive a scholarship from an external organisation. Can I still enrol in this programme?

You can still enrol in this special track. You will need to inform SUTD of your intention not to take up the scholarship.
