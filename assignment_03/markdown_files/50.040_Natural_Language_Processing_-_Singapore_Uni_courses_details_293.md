50.040 Natural Language Processing
==================================

##### **Course Description**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important area within the general field of artificial Intelligence (AI). Modern NLP models focus on using machine learning algorithms for solving various text processing problems. This course covers fundamental topics within the domain of NLP, including part-of-speech tagging, word embeddings, chunking, syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling, semantic parsing, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, generation, summarization and machine translation. Students will get a chance to learn fundamental algorithms as well as state-of-the-art, deep-learning based techniques for NLP and will get a chance to implement and play with advanced NLP algorithms and models.
