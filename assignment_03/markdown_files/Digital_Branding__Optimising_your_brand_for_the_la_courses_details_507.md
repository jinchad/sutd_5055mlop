Overview
========

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Strategic Digital Marketing](/repo/course/modularmaster-in-strategic-digital-marketing/ "ModularMasters in Strategic Digital Marketing") programme**

Digital has fundamentally shifted communication between brands and their consumers from a one-way broadcast to a two-way dialogue. In a hastened bid to transform their businesses to be digital market-ready, most businesses leave their brands behind in their traditional mode, simply replicate their existing brand message for the digital platform, or are unsure of how to make a transition.

Pressured by the need to make their brands work to meet business objectives, the challenges get compounded. This course will address those vital gaps and give participants an understanding of what digital branding is, in the context of traditional branding and how it can be optimized for the critical role it plays in digital marketing.

Participants will learn how, in an era of sheer mass of information, legendary archetypes can be used to create the positioning differentiation to connect with consumers and be trained on how to craft their own brand story–walking away complete with a Positioning Map Model (which can continually be applied to cater to different product growth cycles or a changing competitive environment) and a Digital Brand Toolkit.

##### **Plan your learning path**

This course can be taken as a module on its own or as part of the **[Graduate Certificate in Digital Marketing Strategies](/repo/course/graduate-certificate-digital-marketing/ "Learn more")** stack and participants will earn 12 subject credits which can also be used towards completing the **[ModularMaster in Strategic Digital Marketing](/repo/course/modularmaster-in-strategic-digital-marketing/ "Learn more")**.
