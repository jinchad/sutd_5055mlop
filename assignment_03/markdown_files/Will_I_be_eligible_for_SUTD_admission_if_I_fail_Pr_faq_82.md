Will I be eligible for SUTD admission if I fail Project Work (PW)?
==================================================================

**From AY2026,** all applicants presenting local GCE A-Level qualifications will need to present a Pass grade in PW to be eligible for admission.  
   
From the 2024 JC1/PU2 cohort, should a student fail PW but is promoted to JC2/PU3, the junior college/Millennia Institute (JC/MI) will assess on a case-by-case basis whether to offer the option to re-take PW in JC2/PU3.  
   
Students who fail PW and are also not promoted to JC2/PU3, will have to offer PW again.
