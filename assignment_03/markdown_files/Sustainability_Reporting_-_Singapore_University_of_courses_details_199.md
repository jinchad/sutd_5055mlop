Overview
========

The course covers both the key concepts and the practice of corporate sustainability in the modern organisation, with a focus on external reporting (e.g. sustainability reporting) and performance assessment (e.g. Environmental, Social, & Governance (ESG) ratings). The objective of this course is to foster understanding about the possibilities and challenges of accounting for corporate sustainability practices in terms of reporting, assuring and measuring outcomes.

Launched in March 2024, the Chartered Engineer (SG) in Sustainability certification programme [CEng (Sustainability)], developed by the IES Chartered Engineering Board (CEB), provides a structured training and certification system for engineers in the sustainability sector. This programme offers professional recognition to qualified engineers, with Chartered Engineer registration serving as an external validation of their experience, expertise, and professional competence.

**Our Sustainability Reporting course is one of the accredited core modules under the CEng (Sustainability) Certification Programme.** Participants who are not pursuing Chartership may still enrol in individual course modules to enhance your skills and knowledge in sustainability.
