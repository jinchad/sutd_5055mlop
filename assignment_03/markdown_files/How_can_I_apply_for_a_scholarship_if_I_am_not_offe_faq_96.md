How can I apply for a scholarship if I am not offered one at admission?
=======================================================================

Students will receive email notifications whenever there are SUTD-administered mid-term scholarships open for application. You can submit an application if you meet the stipulated criteria.  
  
Do note that these scholarships are limited in numbers and are awarded on the basis of competition among eligible applicants. For International Students, scholarships generally cover up to the tuition fees for a Singapore Citizen unless specified otherwise.  
  
Alternatively, you may consider applying forÂ [external scholarships](/admissions/undergraduate/scholarship/external-sponsored/).
