Many organisations, especially MNCs and large organisations, need to comply with GDPR. This course equips personnel such as Data Protection Officer (DPO), legal counsel, risk and compliance managers, internal auditors with data protection responsibilities, so as to help the organisations in meeting data protection obligations and gain consumers’ trust.

The IAPP privacy certifications (CIPM, CIPP, CIPT) are widely recognised by recruiters and sought-after credentials for privacy professionals such as data protection officers, risk and compliance, data protection auditors, data protection consultants, and legal professionals.
