### Overview

With the ever-growing number of data protection laws and regulations, privacy responsibilities can land on almost anyone’s desk with no warning or training.

This course provides ready-to-go knowledge for staff at any level of your organisation to put to work immediately, even without becoming fully trained privacy professionals.

This introductory course allows organisations to cultivate in-house privacy knowledge in operational areas with growing privacy responsibilities, such as marketing, human resources, technology and finance. The course modules can integrate with corporate learning management systems for easy inclusion into existing training programmes.

At the same time, this course provides a foundation for learners to take the next step in pursuing our [CIPM](/course/certified-information-privacy-manager-cipm/), [CIPP/E](/course/certified-information-privacy-professional-europe-cipp-e/) or [CIPT](/course/certified-information-privacy-technologist-cipt/) courses, which will further prepare learners for the respective IAPP certification examinations.
