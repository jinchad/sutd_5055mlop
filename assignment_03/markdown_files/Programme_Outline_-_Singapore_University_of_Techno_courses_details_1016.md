### Programme Outline

##### **Learning Objectives and Structure**

By the end of this course, participants should be able to:

* Create scatter plot and statistical plots like box plot, histogram, and bar plot
* Create a Panda’s DataFrame and selecting data from DataFrame
* Use library to read Comma-separated values (CSV) or EXCEL file
* Split data randomly into training set and testing set
* Give example of linear regression and classification
* Evaluate linear regression model using r and mean-squared-error
* Plot linear regression
* Train logistic regression model
* Calculate confusion matrix, precision, and recall
