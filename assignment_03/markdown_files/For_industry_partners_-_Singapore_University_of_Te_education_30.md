The Capstone project is a University-Industry partnership whereby students work in cross-functional teams to solve real-world challenges. Working in teams of 5 to 7 students, these final-year undergraduate students will learn to apply the principles, concepts, techniques that they have learnt to investigate your technical and business challenges.

A Capstone project is an industry-based project which gives senior year undergraduate students the opportunity to practically apply the knowledge, principles, concepts and techniques they have learned to solve multi-disciplinary challenges. It aims to give students a holistic, integrative design experience that requires an extensive range of technological design skills and knowledge such as:



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Identifying real world needs | Transforming needs into technical specifications or design strategies |
| Applying modelling techniques and evaluating design alternatives | Using teamwork to resolve the challenges in designing and validating a tangible solution |
