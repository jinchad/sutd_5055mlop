Are all diplomas accepted for admission?
========================================

Generally, diplomas from the School of Engineering, Information Technology, Architecture or Sciences are considered more relevant to SUTDâ€™s courses and hence will be assessed more favourably for admission. However, other diplomas may still be considered on a case-by-case basis.
