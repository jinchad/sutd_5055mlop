What if I am unsuccessful for the SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track?
==============================================================

As the admissions process is independent for both SUTD and Duke-NUS, the admissions outcome will be independent for both programmes. To be considered for this special track, applicants must be given a firm offer into the undergraduate programme from SUTD AND a conditional offer into the Doctor of Medicine (MD) programme from Duke-NUS. If you had attended an interview with Duke-NUS but were not given the conditional offer into the MD programme, you may appeal to Duke-NUS.
