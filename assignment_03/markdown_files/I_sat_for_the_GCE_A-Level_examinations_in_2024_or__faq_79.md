I_sat_for_the_GCE_A-Level_examinations_in_2024_or_



I sat for the GCE A-Level examinations in 2024 or earlier. How will my UAS be computed if I apply for admission to SUTD in AY2026 or later?
===========================================================================================================================================

**For admission in AY2026 and AY2027**  
For applicants who sat for the GCE A-Level examination in 2024 or earlier, their PW, as well as H1 and H2 content-based subject grades will be taken into consideration for UAS computation, as per current practice. Applicants who offered H2 KI can use it in lieu of H1 GP and the H1 content-based subject in UAS computation. Their UAS will be computed on the existing 90-point scale and proportionately weighted to the revised 70-point scale.  
   
**For admissions from AY2028**  
Regardless of the year of GCE A-Level examination, applicants’ UAS will be computed using the revised 70-point scale.  
   
The PW grade will not be considered in the UAS computation from AY2028. An applicant would be considered to have met the requirement for admission if he/she presents a Pass grade in PW. If an applicant had previously offered H2 Knowledge & Inquiry (KI) in lieu of H1 General Paper (GP), the H2 KI grade will be considered as the H1 GP grade in the revised UAS computation from AY2028.
