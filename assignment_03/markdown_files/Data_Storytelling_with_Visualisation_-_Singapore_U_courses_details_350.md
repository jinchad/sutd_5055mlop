### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science](/course/ModularMaster-in-Data-Science "ModularMasters in Data Science") programme**

A picture speaks a thousand words. According to the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/the-value-of-data/), the world produces 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily and we need to be able to quickly and effectively understand what data means and be able to make decisions based on numbers and patterns. Data visualisation helps us to identify patterns, trends, understand relationships and provide better data presentation through visuals such as graphs, charts, and information visuals.

The course will be leveraging real business data and examples to illustrate the application of data storytelling and visualization tools. The focus will be on practical application and usage of the tools to create tangible output by the end of the course. Students are expected to work in groups to complete a case study using either Tableau or PowerBI, demonstrating the application of data storytelling skills for their final project.
