Is there a possibility that I might lose the conditional offer into the Doctor of Medicine (MD) programme from Duke-NUS?
========================================================================================================================

Conditional admission to MD programme may be lost if any of the following occur during your undergraduate programme with SUTD:

* Withdrawal from SUTD
* Failure to achieve the required grade on completion of the degree
* Violate a standard of academic or ethical conduct policy or any other applicable policy of SUTD where the potential outcome could result in a failing assignment or exam grade, a failing course grade, or disciplinary action (including but not limited to probation, suspension, expulsion or removal from the university)
