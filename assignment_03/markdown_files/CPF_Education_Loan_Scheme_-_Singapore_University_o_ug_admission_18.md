### CPF Education Loan Scheme



The CPF Education Loan Scheme enables members to use CPF savings from their Ordinary Account to pay for their children or their own tuition fees. The student has to repay the amount withdrawn plus interest, in cash subsequently.



##### **Eligibility**



Full-time undergraduate students (Singapore Citizen and Singapore Permanent Resident) can use their own CPF savings, their spouses’ and their parents’ (including step-parents’) CPF savings.



##### **Loan Amount**



Up to 100% of subsidised tuition fees payable by undergraduate students.



##### **Administrative Fee**



An administrative fee of S$10, which may be revised from time to time, plus GST, will be charged for each deduction from the CPF member’s Ordinary Account. This fee and GST will be deducted from the CPF member’s Ordinary Account and will form part of the CPF savings withdrawn to be repaid by the student.



##### **Interest**



Interest is computed from the date the CPF savings are deducted, pegged at the [prevailing CPF interest rate](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/cpf-interest-rates/what-are-the-cpf-interest-rates).



##### **Repayment**



The student is required to repay to the CPF member’s CPF account, the CPF savings withdrawn under the Education Loan Scheme including interest.  
  
The repayment can be made in one lump sum or in monthly instalments over a maximum period of 12 years.  
  
For outstanding amounts of up to S$10,000, the minimum repayment per month is S$100.  
  
Repayment begins one year after the student graduates or one year after he leaves the course, whichever is earlier.  
  
All repayments must be in cash.



##### **Application Period**



**Existing Students:** Application will open on **29 November 2024** and close on **2 January 2025**




##### **How to Apply**



Apply online via the [CPF Board Portal](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/tools-and-services/forms-e-applications/apply-for-cpf-education-loan).



Note:

1. Applicant is the student himself or herself, not the parent.
