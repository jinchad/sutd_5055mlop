### Programme Outline

##### **Learning Objectives**

1. Recognise that although a serious game is designed for the purpose of enhancing user engagement and immersive experience, it requires an instructional design approach with a specific learning objective.
2. Describe the interplay between cellular and molecular storage mechanisms and the cognitive neuroscience of memory and learning, particularly how the brain supports these processes.
3. A key concept of game play is motivation. Participants will explore how learning and motivational theories support the use of games for learning.
4. Analysing a game’s formal conceptual design, its elements, and their relation to each other based on the games purpose is a constructive first step in assessing serious games. Participants will be introduced to the Serious Games Design Assessment (SGDA) Framework and will learn how to use it.
5. Be equipped with basic instructional design knowledge to meaningfully design, develop, and evaluate a serious game.
