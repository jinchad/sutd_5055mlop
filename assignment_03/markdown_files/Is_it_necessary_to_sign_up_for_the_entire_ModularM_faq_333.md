Is it necessary to sign up for the entire ModularMaster programme upfront?
==========================================================================

No, thereâ€™s no need to enroll upfront (except for SCTP). Unlike traditional programmes, ModularMaster Certificate Programmes are flexible and modular. You can select the modules under the specific domain you prefer and combine the necessary Subject Credits to qualify for the MM credential.
