Overview
========

Application of data analytics in semiconductor industry and analysis of large industrial data contribute to improved operational efficiency and business processes. This course equips participants with knowledge about applications of data analytics in the field of yield and reliability analysis in semiconductor devices/systems.

Yield optimisation has been regarded as one of the critical goals in the semiconductor operations and IC manufacturing. Reliability issues in semiconductor devices/systems lead to failure of devices/systems in turn resulting in poor yield. Big data proves to be imperative in semiconductor industry and data processing requires specific data analytics with specific models for data visualisation and analysis.

Data analytics approach provides the ability to evaluate the impact of many variables affecting the reliability and yield in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Hands-on sessions with data analysis models/tools help participants to improve operational tasks and increase work productivity.
