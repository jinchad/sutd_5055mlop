Should_we_receive_a_Purchase_Order_(PO)_before_ini



Should we receive a Purchase Order (PO) before initiating the order processing, or is it acceptable to have a separate confirmation to proceed with the order and receive the PO at a later stage, possibly after delivery?
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Suppliers should always ensure there is a valid Purchase Order (PO) before delivery. Order confirmation is optional.
