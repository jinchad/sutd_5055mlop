What_if_I_had_applied_for_financing_schemes_such_a



What if I had applied for financing schemes such as Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA), Tuition Fee Loan (TFL), CPF Education Loan Scheme (CPFELS) and/or Study Loan (SL), but I am then given financial aid awards?
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Your financial aid awards will apply first, followed by PSEA, CPFELS, TFLÂ and SL, depending on which scheme you had applied for.
