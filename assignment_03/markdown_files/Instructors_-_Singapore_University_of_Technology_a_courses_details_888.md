### Instructor

#### 

Head of Cluster, Science, Mathematics and Technology, Associate Professor

Dario obtained a joint PhD in Physics from the National University of Singapore and Australian National University in 2009. In 2005, he obtained his MEng in Nuclear Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and MEng in Applied Physics from Ecole Centrale Paris. He has worked as a research fellow at the Center for Quantum Technologies, at Ecole Polytechnique and at the University of Geneva. He holds the designation of Associate Head of Cluster for Graduate Programme and Research in the Science, Mathematics and Technology Cluster in SUTD and he is the Director of the SUTD Honours and Research Programme. His interests lie in the physics of quantum complex systems and on the numerical methods used to study them.

#### **Antonios Varvitsiotis**

Assistant Professor, ESD

Dr Varvitsiotis received a PhD in Mathematical Optimization from the Dutch National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI). Prior to joining SUTD he held Research Fellow positions at the Centre for Quantum Technologies (Computer Science group) and the National University of Singapore (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering). He also holds a MSc degree in Theoretical Computer Science and a BSc in Applied and Theoretical Mathematics, both from the National University of Athens in Greece. Dr Varvitsiotis’ research is focused on fundamental aspects of continuous and discrete optimisation, motivated by real-life applications in data science, machine learning, engineering, and quantum information.

#### **Wu Chunfeng**

Senior Lecturer, SMT

Chunfeng possesses a PhD in Physics from the National University of Singapore and a MSc in Physics from Northeast Normal University, China. She holds the designation of Senior Lecturer in the Science, Mathematics and Technology cluster in SUTD. Her research mainly focuses on quantum physics, especially quantum information and computation. Specific research areas include quantum optics and its application in quantum computation and simulation, quantum correlations, and quantum decoherence and quantum control.
