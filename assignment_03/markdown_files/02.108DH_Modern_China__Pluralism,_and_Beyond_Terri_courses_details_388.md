02.108DH Modern China: Pluralism, and Beyond Territoriality
===========================================================

This survey course explores the history of Modern China from the perspective of China’s interaction with modernity from within and without. In particular, it examines this dialectical relationship whereby China is seemingly “simultaneously enchanted and repelled” by changes either introduced to it. This course introduces key events, personages, and documents and provides students with an “inside perspective,” cultivating a detailed understanding, based on original sources, of the evolution of contemporary China. It further surveys theories and concepts that help analyze Chinese history. It will also familiarize students with past and current scholarships on China, and considers debates about the nature of China’s historical developments.
