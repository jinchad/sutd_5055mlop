### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Digital HR](/course/ModularMaster-in-Digital-HR "ModularMasters in Digital HR") programme**

We are working in a rapidly digitised world. The pandemic has brought on a deeper acceleration of the adoption of all types of digital technologies for work, communication, simplification of processes as well as adopting different platforms for the integration of business processes. The HR function will need to lead this digital transformation through the integration of HR Processes and systems to enhance employee experience in order to compete in this digital world for talent. This course will introduce participants to the latest technologies and equip them with the skill sets to identify suitable processes to design the HR technology strategy around the employee digital lifecycle. It also touches on the different types of technologies available for HR automation and equips them with the skills to identify and choose the right vendor for their HR applications. Participants will also be taught the skills to do mini bots using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and its approach, including activities, roles and key outputs for a successful implementation.

The course will culminate in a real-life project to automate HR processes using the principles taught in this class.
