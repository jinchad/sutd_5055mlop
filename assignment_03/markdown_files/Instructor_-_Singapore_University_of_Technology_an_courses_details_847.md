#### **Low Hong Yee**

**Head of Pillar (EPD), Professor (EPD)**  
Singapore University of Technology and Design

Hong Yee Low received her PhD from Case Western Reserve University in 1998, in the area of polymer science and engineering. She spent about 2 years in Motorola Semiconductor Sector in Malaysia. To pursue her interest in materials research, she joined the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE) in 2000.

During her career in IMRE, she has held a few key appointments including the department head for the Patterning and Fabrication Capability group for 5 years, principle investigator /program director for nanoimprinting research since 2003, as well as the director of research for 2 years. In terms of research, she has been working on nanoimprinting of biomimetic surfaces. Her team has developed a variety of biomimetic surface functionalities onto engineering polymers, which she believes has a good potential to be a more sustainable technology to impart and improve product performance without relying on chemicals.

#### **Tan Ying Yi**

Research Fellow, Digital Manufacturing and Design Centre (DManD)  
Singapore University of Technology and Design

Ying Yi is a Research Fellow from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). Ever since his initial PhD advisor procured a knitting machine in 2017, he has been involved in the various SUTD knitting research that span across architecture, engineering, computational, art and healthcare domains. Ying Yi’s PhD work reconciles his architecture roots and on-the-job skillset in machine-knitting through the digital design and manufacturing of bespoke textiles for architectural applications. As a researcher, he is currently working on comparatively smaller-scale smart knitwear while guiding students on knitting-related projects.

#### **Christyasto Priyonggo Pambudi**

Research Assistant, Digital Manufacturing and Design Centre (DManD)  
Singapore University of Technology and Design

Christyasto received his bachelor’s degree in architecture from Singapore University of Technology and Design. With several years of experience as a Researcher in SUTD, he has been exposed to many different disciplines; knitted fabric being one of the most recent topics. Some of his projects include Knitted Tensegrity Pavilion as well as Knitted Mycelium Composite. Besides knitting, he has also developed much interest in parametric design, digital modeling, and fabrication in application to many of his work over the years.

#### **Benjamin Lim En How**

Research Assistant, Digital Manufacturing and Design Centre (DManD)  
Singapore University of Technology and Design

With a training in Architecture and Visual Arts, Benjamin has a keen interest in a myriad of design fields. Currently a researcher in the Knitting and Textiles Lab, Benjamin has worked with developing textiles for use in biological, architectural and engineering research, while expanding his expertise in fashion and consumer apparel design. A firm believer in both modern technological tools and traditional art forms, Benjamin is also experienced in parametric design and digital fabrication, while practicing woodworking and painting in his leisure time.



##### **Chia Pei Zhi**

Research Assistant, Digital Manufacturing and Design Centre (DManD)  
Singapore University of Technology and Design

Pei Zhi is an experienced CNC knitting researcher, soft goods prototyper, and bag sewing instructor. The diverse range of products that she has developed includes architectural pavilion membranes and formworks, e-textiles and healthcare wearables, prosthetic liners, and plus-sized juggling chooks. She also used to manage and teach sewing classes in a local sewing studio. Somewhat incongruently, but with no regrets, she studied geography in the National University of Singapore.
