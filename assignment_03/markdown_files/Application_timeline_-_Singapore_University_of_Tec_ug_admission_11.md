Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

###### Can a local polytechnic student apply with only 5 semesters results? Will those applying with a full set of Poly results have an advantage?

If you are currently in your final semester, you can apply by submitting results from your first five semesters during the [application window](/admissions/undergraduate/local-diploma/application-timeline/), and upload your final transcript **within three days upon receipt**. There will not be any advantage accorded to either groups applying with five semesters or full diploma results.

---

###### Does SUTD accept PFP instead of GCE O-Level results for admission?

We do consider your PFP results. In addition, we will also take into consideration your performance in relevant modules in the diploma, e.g. Engineering/Computing Mathematics, in our evaluation of your application for admissions.

---

###### What are your minimum CGPA requirements?

We do not impose a minimum CGPA requirement, as we evaluate all applications on a comprehensive basis. Beyond your CGPA, we also consider how you performed in relevant subjects, e.g. Engineering/Computing Mathematics.

Your grades in the advanced modules will also be taken into consideration. You should also possess a good pass in your Additional Mathematics and Science subjects, i.e. Physics or Chemistry, in the GCE O-Level or equivalent qualification.

---

###### Are all diplomas accepted for admission?

Generally, diplomas from the School of Engineering, Information Technology, Architecture or Sciences are considered more relevant to SUTD’s courses and hence will be assessed more favourably for admission. However, other diplomas may still be considered on a case-by-case basis.
