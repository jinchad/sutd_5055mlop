### Overview

In the face of escalating costs, labour shortages, and changing consumer demands, modern agriculture is under pressure to innovate and adapt. The advent of agriculture technology (agtech) offers promising solutions to these challenges. Agtech encompasses a range of technologies, such as precision agriculture, smart irrigation, biotechnology, automation, indoor vertical farming, livestock technology, modern greenhouse practices, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. This workshop aims to explore these advancements and their application in enhancing the efficiency, productivity, and sustainability of food production.

This 6-day workshop in Bangkok, Thailand, is designed for adult leaders from Singapore involved in the food supply chain industry. It aims to provide insights into the latest agricultural technologies and how they can be leveraged to transform the industry.

The additional half-day post workshop on Smart Farming that will be conducted 2 weeks after the trip in Singapore will provide a working proposition for participants on their contribution to the 30/30 vision for food supply chain in the country.
