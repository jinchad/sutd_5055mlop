If this is my second internship, is it mandatory for it to be official?
=======================================================================

If you applied for your internship through SUTD’s Career Development Centre (via SUTD MyPortal or through a Career Development Centre staff), it will be considered an official internship, and you will be required to submit the necessary reports and posters, and will be covered under the relevant clauses. If internship was procured by your own means, you have the option of either having the internship officially endorsed, or for it to remain unofficial. This would have to be made known to us via careers@sutd.edu.sg at least one month prior to the start of the internship. The official guidelines will be sent to you when the internship portal opens. Please note that the instructions in the official guidelines will supersede this FAQ.
