02.154 HT Environmental Humanities
==================================

The course seeks to help students develop an integrated understanding of environmental and ecological issues from the point of view of the humanities, broadly understood (incorporating literature, the arts, philosophy and cultural studies), in conjunction with technology. The course will consist of readings of excerpts from several imaginative works such as novels and stories, combined with some theoretical readings from non-fiction that help us engage with these texts. These readings will be combined with assignments involving both traditional essays and hands-on exploration of the students’ own geospatial environment in Singapore as case study, the latter to be documented with the help of user-centered digital mapping using tools and resources such as QGIS, GeoCommons and OpenStreetMaps.



##### **Learning Objectives**



1. Develop an understanding of the interaction between the cultural and the material aspects in the human environment (both natural and built environments)
2. Develop the ability to craft narratives about the natural environment and the built environment using both verbal skills and technological tools
3. Develop an understanding of the complexity of the problems faced by humans and non-humans in the current Anthropocene era
4. Foster an imaginative capacity of empathy for other living organisms
