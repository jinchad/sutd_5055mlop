###### **Immersion**

There are various channels to get to know more about SUTD, our programmes, how our students learn, and the vibrant campus life here. Apart from participating at education talks and fairs, we have various programmes that give students an immersive experience of SUTD.

Through these immersion programmes, not only do we hope to reaffirm SUTD as students’ university of choice, we also hope to inspire prospective students to pursue their undergraduate studies and subsequently a lifelong career in Science, Technology, Engineering, Architecture and Mathematics.
