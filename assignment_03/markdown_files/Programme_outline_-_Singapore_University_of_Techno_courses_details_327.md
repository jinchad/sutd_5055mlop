### Programme outline

##### **Learning objectives**

By the end of the course, participants will learn:

* to understand the principles and applications of foundation models in the legal domain.
* to employ prompt engineering techniques to optimise the performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants.
* to utilise Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as legal document summarisation, classification, and information extraction.
* to identify and implement Generative AI use cases to improve legal workflows.
* to evaluate the impact of Generative AI on legal practice and decision-making processes.
* to conduct hands-on experiments with Generative AI tools and technologies to reinforce learning.
