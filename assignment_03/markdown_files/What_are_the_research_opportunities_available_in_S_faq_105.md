What are the research opportunities available in SUTD for undergraduates?
=========================================================================

All undergraduates are welcome to participate in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP), where you can explore your research interests and participate in different phases of standard research activity. Students can either initiate research projects or apply for faculty-led projects. Successful UROP proposals will be supported with $1,500 in funding for consumables and materials according to prevailing UROP funding guidelines. You may refer to the [UROP webpage](/campus-life/undergraduate-opportunities-programme/urop/) for more information.  
   
Alternatively, students who aspire to pursue a research-related career may consider applying for the [SUTD Honours and Research Programme (SHARP)](/education/undergraduate/special-programmes/sharp/overview/) at the point of admission.
