Search Engines are where people head to when looking for what to eat, what to do, where to go, what to buy, and more. Businesses vie for the attention of the audience and to appear where and when these audiences expect. A well-executed paid ad strategy is an effective way to reach targeted audiences and is critical to modern integrated marketing strategies. However, managing budgets while ensuring reach and conversion to the right audiences is key to a successful campaign.

Google Ads, previously known as AdWords is no stranger to marketers and even business owners. Businesses need to understand the power of search.

This 5-day programme equips modern marketers with the fundamentals of Search Advertising and participants will learn how to formulate a Search Ad Strategy based on best practices to drive successful digital marketing campaigns.
