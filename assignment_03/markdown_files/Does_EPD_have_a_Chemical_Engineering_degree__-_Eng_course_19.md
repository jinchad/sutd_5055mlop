Does EPD have a Chemical Engineering degree?
============================================

We do not have a chemical engineering degree. However, it is possible to take classes that focuses on certain Chemical Engineering aspects (e.g., sustainability or sustainable engineering) via the [self-directed track](/epd/education/undergraduate/specialisation-tracks/self-directed-programme/). We encourage students to consult and speak your faculty mentors or pillar administrators about the classes one should take to pursue their interest on a given area.
