Does SUTD accept PFP instead of GCE O-Level results for admission?
==================================================================

We do consider your PFP results. In addition, we will also take into consideration your performance in relevant modules in the diploma, e.g. Engineering/Computing Mathematics, in our evaluation of your application for admissions.
