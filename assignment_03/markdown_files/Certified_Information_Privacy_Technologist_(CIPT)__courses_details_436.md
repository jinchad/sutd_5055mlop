### Overview

Many countries have enacted data protection laws. The general public’s awareness of the needs to protect privacy and personal data has increased in recent years amidst the many data breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Privacy has emerged as a new frontier in competitive strategy as the rapid development of technologies poses new threats to one’s privacy.

This course is designed to equip participants with the essential knowledge and skills on how to integrate privacy preserving principles and designs into technology, products and systems that not only comply with the laws but also gain the trust of consumers. With technologies becoming more pervasive and ubiquitous, companies need to effectively manage privacy risks in technologies and products. These include how to evaluate, buy, develop, or deploy technologies into products and systems that protect users’ privacy.

This course will further prepare learners for the optional IAPP certification examination (not included in this course) which participants are encouraged to sit for. The IAPP privacy certifications (CIPM, CIPP, CIPT) are widely recognised by recruiters and sought-after credentials for privacy professionals such as data protection officers, risk and compliance, data protection auditors, data protection consultants, and legal professionals.
