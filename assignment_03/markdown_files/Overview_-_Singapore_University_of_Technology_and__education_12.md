### Overview

**Project submissions for Capstone 2025/2026 is now open**

SUTD was set up to develop technically-grounded leaders and innovators who will contribute to improving the world. Believing that society is in need of technology-based services, products and systems, SUTD broke from tradition to provide students with a multidisciplinary curriculum delivered via a hands-on, collaborative learning pedagogy and environment.

A key element of this learning philosophy is the Capstone project which aims to crystallise various learnings of a student and gives them a cumulative mastery of all their learning experiences at SUTD.

The Capstone project brings together students from different Majors to work in design teams, contributing their respective expertise and skills to solve real-world challenges. It also provides them with a realistic design situation where projects usually span multiple disciplines and require team-based efforts to create a solution.
