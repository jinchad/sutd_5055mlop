Is there an overseas component to MSSD?
=======================================

Yes. SUTD is currently working with its international partners in the UK, Netherlands, and USA to create attachment opportunities for MSSD students. An international attachment will enable a student to complete the project/thesis requirement at a partner university during Term 3. Such attachments will usually be 14-weeks in durations. A faculty advisor at SUTD and a co-advisor at the partner institution will advise students who decide to complete their project/thesis abroad.
