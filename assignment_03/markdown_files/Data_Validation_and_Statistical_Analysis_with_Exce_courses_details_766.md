### Overview

##### Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Academy/Our-Offerings/MyModularMaster/ModularMaster-in-Data-Science "ModularMasters in Data Science") (Non-Programming Track) programme

Effective data science project relies on one critical aspect, data quality. With the right data quality, statistical analysis can then take place which translates data into meaningful insights for businesses. Data Validation plays an important role in ensuring the data is correct and useful in preparation for analysis.

This course is designed to introduce the general concepts of Data Science with a focus on Data Validation and Statistical Analysis for participants with non-programming backgrounds. By the end of this course, participants will be able to leverage on Excel for Data Validation and Statistical Analysis.
