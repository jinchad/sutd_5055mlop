02.166TS Urban Southeast Asia: Diversity, Sustainability and Change
===================================================================

Southeast Asia is a region of extraordinary natural, cultural, economic, and socio-political diversity. It is characterised by both patterns of continuity across time and space, as well as far-reaching and rapid social and physical development. These changes often centre around the region’s vibrant urban areas. This course surveys a variety of contemporary trends and challenges found across Southeast Asian cities surrounding the intersecting themes of diversity, sustainability, and change. We will explore what exactly makes this region – our region – so unique: its historical context, geopolitics, cultural and technological innovations, heritage practices, and urban design. At the same time, we will investigate how these factors impact Southeast Asia’s sustainable development goals, and therefore how we might imagine the role Southeast Asia could play in the future of our world. This is a survey course, and while you will be exposed to a wide range of issues relevant to contemporary Southeast Asia, you will also be encouraged to delve deeper into one or two select topics that are of particular interest to you.
