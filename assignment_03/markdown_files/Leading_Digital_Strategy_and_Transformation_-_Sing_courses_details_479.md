Overview
========

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Technology and Management](/repo/course/modularmaster-in-technology-and-management/ "ModularMasters in Technology and Management") programme**

The leading digital strategy and transformation module provides students with in-depth understanding of the on-going changes in various industries that result from digital technologies and platforms. As digital technologies are now reaching maturity, the key barriers to digital transformation lie in management and organising.

The module will cover the newest theoretical frameworks and ideas connected to digital ecosystems, platforms, business models, and management practices. The course investigates changes in industry structures, customer relationships and services, organisational design, capabilities and culture in order to understand the catalysts and barriers to digital transformation.

While the focus is on management, we will also go through recent developments in Information technology along with emerging business applications in service and manufacturing industries. The participants will discuss case studies and develop their abilities in the design and implementation of digital strategies and transformations.
