I_sat_for_the_GCE_A-Level_examination_in_2024_or_e



I sat for the GCE A-Level examination in 2024 or earlier. Will I be allowed to use H2 KI as one of my H2 content-based subjects in the UAS computation when I apply to SUTD in AY2026 or later?
===============================================================================================================================================================================================

Applicants who had sat for the GCE A-Level examinations in 2024 or earlier and offered H2 Knowledge & Inquiry (KI) in lieu of H1 General Paper (GP) **will not** be allowed to use H2 KI as a H2 content-based subject in the UAS computation as the H2 KI grade will be required to fulfil the H1 GP requirement under the revised UAS computation.
