### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Digital HR](/course/ModularMaster-in-Digital-HR "ModularMasters in Digital HR") programme**

Digital communication is an important and indispensable skill that every employee and every manager need to master in this hyper-connected and hyper-digital work environment. Effective digital communication is a must, not a ‘nice to have’ in today’s work environment because it represents the glue that binds all aspects of the business together. Furthermore, your ability to communicate digitally using the right strategy to the right audience is what separates you from being perceived as a great leader from an ordinary leader.

This course teaches you how to communicate more effectively using digital media and tools to achieve your goals. Digital communication is much more than good writing on a screen or putting all your communication efforts online. There are both hard digital skills and soft digital skills to acquire so that you can continuously connect, engage and inspire your audience in the digital spaces.

There are key differences when it comes to communicating in the plethora of digital tools that are readily and widely available. You need to be real, approachable and human.

Other than learning about the key aspects of digital communication, you will learn the art of storytelling, team communication essentials and the DNA of branding to develop the digital communication strategy to meet your goals. Taught by award-winning, SUTD Academy Adjunct Senior Fellow, former corporate leader and author Dr Jovina Ang, “Digital Communication” is an essential course designed to give you the tools, frameworks and strategies for your advantage. This is an immersive course where you will be exposed to real business challenges to enhance your learning and digital communication skills.
