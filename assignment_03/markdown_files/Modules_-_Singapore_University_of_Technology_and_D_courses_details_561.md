### Modules

##### **Digital Communication**

This course teaches you how to communicate more effectively using digital media and tools to achieve your goals. Digital communication is much more than good writing on a screen or putting all your communication efforts online. There are both hard digital skills and soft digital skills to acquire so that you can continuously connect, engage and inspire your audience in the digital spaces.

##### **Leadership and Change Management**

Leadership and Change Management equips participants to become effective leaders and change agents within their organisation. The course commences with a section on the inevitability of change in today’s globalised business environment, impressing on students the importance of responding to (and potentially capitalising on) that change. The course then introduces the systemic leadership approach before covering different leadership theories and sources of power and legitimacy that leaders often employ.
