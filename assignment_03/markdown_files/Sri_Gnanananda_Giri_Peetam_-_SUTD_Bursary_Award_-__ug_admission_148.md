Founded by a renowned lineage of Hindu Saints in the name of the peerless Saint, His Holiness Paramahamsa Parivrajakacharya Jagathguru Sri Gnanananda Giri Swamigal, and currently headed by His Holiness Sathguru Sri Niranjanananda Giri Swamigal, it is in fact a secular organisation that strives to bring upliftment and relief to all of humanity and the world, through many of its global charity projects.
