Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster Certificate in Technology and Management](/repo/course/modularmaster-in-technology-and-management/ "ModularMasters in Technology and Management")**

As our world becomes increasingly digitised, digital security grows more crucial than ever. While advances in technology present new opportunities for us to live, work, and play, they also make us more vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. What if our everyday digital services cease to function, or if our data is no longer secure?

Because technological innovation is a double-edged sword, it’s important to build a company’s digital security, starting at the strategic level, producing a relatively abstract vision that is molded at the operational level into proscribed operating instructions: a security and enablement plan.

This course provides a comprehensive understanding into today’s digital security environment, and how we can apply the knowledge to minimise risk, leverage opportunities, and implement solutions to best manage cybersecurity and risks.
