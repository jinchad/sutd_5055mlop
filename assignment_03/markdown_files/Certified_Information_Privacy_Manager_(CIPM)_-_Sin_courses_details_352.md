### Overview

Data Protection Officer (DPO) is an emerging job role. Almost all the data protection laws in the world require organisations to appoint a DPO by law. There is a shortage of data protection officers worldwide, including Singapore. DPO is ideal for mid-career PMET in the digital economy.

This course is designed to transform the knowledge of data protection regulations and policies into implementable and practical day-to-day operations. Participants will learn the benefits of data protection, the principles and regulations of data protection, and how to implement an effective data protection management programme with the necessary knowledge, skills, tools, and methods.

Participants will learn how to draft a data protection policy, build a data protection team, compile a data inventory map, assess data management risk, embed Privacy by Design into systems and processes, conduct Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), plan for data breach response, conduct data protection audit, and measure the effectiveness of the data protection management programme.

This course will further prepare learners for the optional IAPP certification examination (not included in this course) which participants are encouraged to sit for. The IAPP privacy certifications (CIPM, CIPP, CIPT) are widely recognised by recruiters and sought-after credentials for privacy professionals such as data protection officers, risk and compliance, data protection auditors, data protection consultants, and legal professionals.
