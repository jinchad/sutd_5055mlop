How do students get a mentor for Thesis?
========================================

While the process will be facilitated by the pillar, students are highly encouraged to approach early faculty whose research interests match theirs. Faculty research interests may be found at their faculty profile pages on the ASD website. Details on the selection process will be shared when programme commences.
