| **THIS BURSARY AWARD IS MADE POSSIBLE BY MS LISA HUANG.**   The Henry & Hailey Qian Bursary, set up by The Community Foundation of Singapore donor Ms Lisa Huang, is named after her two children. Having previously contributed to rural schools, as well as children with heart conditions, in Shanghai, Ms Huang continues her support of the younger generation here in Singapore.    She believes that empowering children, especially the young ones who are unable to fend for themselves, by improving their health and education, will boost their social mobility and lead to a stronger society in Singapore. |
