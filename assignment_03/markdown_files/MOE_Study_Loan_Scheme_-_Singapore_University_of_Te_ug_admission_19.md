### MOE Study Loan Scheme



All students (i.e. SC/SPR/IS) studying full-time in MOE subsidised undergraduate degree courses in SUTD are eligible to apply for the MOE Study Loan Scheme provided they have been awarded one or a combination of the following three schemes covering at least 80% of the subsidised fees payable by Singapore Citizens (SC).



* [MOE Tuition Fee Loan (TFL)](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/other-financing-options/moe-tuition-fee-loan/)
* [CPF Education Loan Scheme (CPFELS)](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/other-financing-options/cpf-education-loan-scheme/)
* [Mendaki Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS)](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/financial-aid/mendaki-tertiary-tuition-fee-subsidy/)


The MOE Study Loan helps to cover a partial amount of the subsidised tuition fees payable by a Singapore Citizen and can also provide a living allowance.
