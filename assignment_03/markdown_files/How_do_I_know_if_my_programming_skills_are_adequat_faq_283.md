How do I know if my programming skills are adequate for admission into MSSD?
============================================================================

Selected candidates will be given a test to assess their programming ability in one of the following programming languages: C/C++, Java, and Python. Applicants unable to pass this test, and who exhibit a strong academic background and/or work experience, will be given an option to go through an intensive course in computer programming before being formally admitted into the MSSD programme. Passing this intensive course will be a pre-requisite to formal entry in the MSSD programme.
