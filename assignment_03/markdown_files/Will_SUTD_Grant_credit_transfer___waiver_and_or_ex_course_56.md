Will SUTD Grant credit transfer / waiver and/or exemption of modules for polytechnic students / students transferring from other universities?
==============================================================================================================================================

No. Due to the unique structure and rigour of the SUTD curriculum, all students will need to enrol in and go through the same programme in the freshman year and first term of the sophomore year (Freshmore) until they choose a pillar thereafter.
