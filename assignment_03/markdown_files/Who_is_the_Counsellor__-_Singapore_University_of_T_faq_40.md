Who is the Counsellor?
======================

SUTD’s Counsellors are professionally trained to support students seeking counselling to better manage their issue or condition. In the event that the issue or condition may require the services beyond what the Wellbeing Services could provide, the Counsellor would discuss alternative care resources with the student, and/or seek informed consent from the student for the Counsellor to work with an appropriate member of the SUTD community or the student’s caregiver to provide the best possible care.
