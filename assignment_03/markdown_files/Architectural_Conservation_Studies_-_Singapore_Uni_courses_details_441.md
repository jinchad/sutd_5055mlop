### Overview

This programme is based on the ICOMOS Singapore and Urban Redevelopment Authority’s [**Conservation Technical Handbook** series](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Conservation/Best-Practices) that aims to promote better quality restoration projects, enhance the level of competency within the heritage building industry and increase appreciation for our built heritage.

The eight-volume series covering different aspects of technical restoration, architectural elements and material usage for heritage buildings will be used as the course structure. The series will contain best practices and technical expertise on restoration works, and detailed information on locally used materials, construction methods and restoration techniques.

Instructors have a broad range of professional conservation experience from institutional to commercial heritage contexts.

##### **This course is accredited with 6 BOA-SIA CPD points.**

Supported by URA and ICOMOS Singapore
