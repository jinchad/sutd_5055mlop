Is it necessary to “Acknowledge” the Purchase Order (PO) in Ariba upon receiving the PO?
========================================================================================

Yes. If you have received the Purchase Order (PO) notification from SUTD and upon logging in to your Ariba account, and the PO is not displayed in your Ariba account, then there is a need to acknowledge this PO by opening it using the correct Ariba account.

Please refer to the [guide on how to “Acknowledge” the first PO](/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Purchase-Order-Acknowledgement.pdf).

If you have received the PO notification from SUTD and upon logging in to your Ariba account, the PO is already displayed in your Ariba account, then no action is needed.

Note that opening the first PO issued by SUTD will establish the trading relationship with SUTD. Consecutive POs will automatically be reflected in your Ariba account.
