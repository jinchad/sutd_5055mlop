### Capstone Design Showcase



The Capstone Design Showcase is held annually as a culminating event for the Capstone Design project. Our final year students pursuing different degree programmes come together to work in multi-disciplinary teams to solve real-world challenges faced by our industry partners.  
   
The Showcase is generally held on campus where visitors and industry partners get to interact with our students as they present their projects. Over the past few years, affected by the pandemic, the Showcase has also gone virtual for the first time in 2020 and even taking on a hybrid format (both on-campus and online) in 2022. Check out the virtual showcases from the past years:
