### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Digital HR](/course/modularmaster-in-digital-hr/ "ModularMasters in Digital HR") programme**

Leadership and Change Management equips participants to become effective leaders and change agents within their organisation. The course commences with a section on the inevitability of change in today’s globalised business environment, impressing on students the importance of responding to (and potentially capitalising on) that change. The course then introduces the systemic leadership approach before covering different leadership theories and sources of power and legitimacy that leaders often employ.

The second half of the course integrates relevant topics from organisational behaviour and social psychology while showing participants common pitfalls and disadvantages associated with certain leadership styles and traits. Participants will be challenged to consider ethical issues in leadership while also highlighting the necessity of good leadership in the implementation of human capital and business strategy.
