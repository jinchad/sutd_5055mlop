Programme highlights
--------------------

The SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track builds on SUTD’s existing offerings and capabilities in healthcare across the pillars, and advances our mission of bettering the world through design. Selected applicants will expand both their engineering/architecture and clinical knowledge in an interdisciplinary learning environment.

Headed by senior leaders from SUTD, Duke-NUS and Changi General Hospital, learning will take place at multiple institutions – SUTD, Duke-NUS Medical School and various healthcare institutions within SingHealth including Changi General Hospital, Singapore General Hospital, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital, national specialty centres and polyclinics.

Being versatile in both technology and design, together with a deep understanding of patients’ needs, you will be at the forefront of healthcare issues by being able to analyse challenges in healthcare and having the know-how to address them with your own innovations. Some areas where you can look to make a difference include healthcare product design (medical devices/equipment), biomaterials, drug delivery, hospital bed allocation systems, patient monitoring, and hospital design.

Successful students will graduate with a **Bachelor of Engineering (BEng)** or **Bachelor of Science (BSc)** degree at SUTD, followed by a **Doctor of Medicine (MD)** degree at Duke-NUS Medical School.

During your undergraduate studies at SUTD, you will be able to work closely with medical professionals and engineering/architecture faculty, as well as get inducted into Duke-NUS Medical School. In particular, you can look forward to the following:

* Be assigned a clinical mentor who will see you through your entire course of study, to provide advice, along with a once-a-term progress review
* Preparatory courses:
  + Team Lead Session
  + 2-day Duke-NUS Alumni Clinical Observership (DACO)
  + “Introduction to SingHealth Duke-NUS ACP” workshop each term
  + MCAT Introduction Session
  + Fundamental Science Workshop (5 sessions)
* Complete a summer internship in a healthcare environment with either Duke-NUS, one of the SingHealth group of hospitals, or a healthcare product manufacturer
* Work on a healthcare-related Capstone project in the final two semesters
* Opportunities to stay engaged with Duke-NUS through extra-curricular activities such as seminars, workshops, and visits
