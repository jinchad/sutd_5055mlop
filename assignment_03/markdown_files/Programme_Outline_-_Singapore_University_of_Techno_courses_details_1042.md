##### Assessment

Multiple methods of assessment are used to provide an opportunity for the participant to demonstrate their learning results with a variety of learning styles. These include:  
• Pre-assignment due before class  
• Class contribution  
• In-session assignments (group work and presentations during the module)  
• Take-home assignment after class

##### **Subject Credits**

Upon completion and satisfying the requirements of passing this course, learners will be awarded 12 subject credits.
