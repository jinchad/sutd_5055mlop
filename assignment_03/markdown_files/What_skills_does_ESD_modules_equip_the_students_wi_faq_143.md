What skills does ESD modules equip the students with and what are the career prospects for ESD graduates?
=========================================================================================================

ESD students will graduate with an analytical mindset when dealing with problems of business and operations, supplemented by the orientation toward design. You will be experienced in communicating and working with clients, and presenting your technical ideas effectively and persuasively. You will be skilled at transforming data into models and using those models to influence major decisions.

ESD graduates are prepared for a wide range of engineering and management careers in a variety of industries, namely system/business analysts, operations managers, and project leaders in both the private and public sectors, including healthcare, banking, manufacturing, supply chain, energy, transportation, and entertainment and hospitality.

Your career progression depends on the industry, company, and activity. For example, in a consulting company, you might expect to follow the path of “analyst-consultant-partner,” in a business you might follow “analyst-manager-director,” in an engineering firm you might follow “engineer-leader-manager-director,” and so on.
