Is there any financial aid for students who are unable to afford the housing fees?
==================================================================================

There are various options to finance your housing fees:



1. Singapore Citizens may choose to utilise funds from their Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) to pay for their housing fees in the first 2 academic terms of their Freshmore year.
2. All students can apply for a Study Loan from DBS bank which provides an allowance that can be used to pay for the housing fees, provided they are already under a Tuition Fee Loan or the CPF Education Loan Scheme, or receiving the Mendaki Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy.


For more information, please refer to the [Financing Options](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/) page.
