How will the financial aid awards be utilised?
==============================================

**Government Bursaries:**  
For [Higher Education Community Bursary (HECB)](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/financial-aid/government-bursaries/#higher-education-community-bursary-scheme) and [Higher Education Bursary (HEB)](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/financial-aid/government-bursaries/#higher-education-bursary-scheme), the funds will be directly credited to the recipients’ bank accounts.  
    
**[SUTD Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG)](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/financial-aid/sutd-education-opportunity-grant/)**\* and/or **[SUTD-administered Study/Bursary Awards](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/financial-aid/study-bursary-awards/):**  
The awards will be used to offset your tuition fees directly. Any excess will be carried forward to the following academic term.  
   
\*The grant from the SEOG may comprise donor-supported EOGs and/or donor bursary awards. Funding for hostel fees is only applicable for the Freshmore terms where hostel stay is compulsory.  
   
[**SUTD-administered Special Programme/Grants**](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/financial-aid/special-programme-grant/)**:**  
The funds will be directly credited to the recipients’ bank accounts.  
   
All financial aid awards do not cover [Compulsory Miscellaneous Fees](/admissions/undergraduate/education-expenses/fees/#compulsory-miscellaneous-fees). Except for SEOG, all other financial aid awards do not provide funding for hostel fees.
