When do we choose our specialisation?
=====================================

SUTD students choose their pillars at the end of their Freshmore year (Term 3). During the second term, students would indicate their preferred tracks within the pillars. Options are available to students to either change their tracks or pillars. There have been instances where these changes were made without impacting the expected graduation dates. There have also been cases, where graduation dates have been delayed by ~3 to 6 months.
