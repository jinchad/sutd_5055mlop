| **THIS BURSARY AWARD IS ESTABLISHED IN HONOUR OF THE LATE MADAM SOH BIN SENG.** |
| The late Madam Soh Bin Seng was an altruistic individual. A very caring and devoted mother, generous and compassionate to others, her resilience and can-do spirit were inspiring to her children.   Madam Soh believed that education was a powerful tool for change, and hence her children, Mr Goh Chong Khing and Ms Goh Peck Hong established a bursary to support financially needy students at SUTD in memory of her.    Mr Goh and Ms Goh want to ensure that financial barriers do not hinder deserving students at SUTD from their path to success. |
