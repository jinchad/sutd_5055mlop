Is the ModularMaster a Master’s degree?
=======================================

No, the ModularMaster programme is not a Master’s degree. It is a unique micro-credential initiative that offers a suite of short, modular professional development courses. Participants can choose to take individual modules separately, stack them towards a Graduate Certificate, or pursue the full ModularMaster (MM) Certificate.
