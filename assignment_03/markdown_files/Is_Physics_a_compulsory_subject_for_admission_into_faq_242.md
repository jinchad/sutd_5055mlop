Is Physics a compulsory subject for admission into SUTD?
========================================================

Physics is not a compulsory subject for admission into SUTD. SUTD practises a comprehensive review of applications, where we consider all **academic** and **personal attributes** to assess if you are able to cope with the rigour of our programme and will fit in well. 



For the former, we look for evidence of competency in Mathematics and the Sciences, i.e. Physics, Chemistry or Biology, in the context of the opportunities afforded to you based on your subject choices. 



Apart from the final year exam results, we also take into consideration your academic performance in the 2-3 years leading to the final exam, including O-Levels, as well as any supplementary tests you may have taken.
