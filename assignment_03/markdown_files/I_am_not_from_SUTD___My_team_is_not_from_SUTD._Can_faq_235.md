I am not from SUTD / My team is not from SUTD. Can we still join this programme?
================================================================================

Yes, we welcome all aspiring founders.. However to be eligible for the Create4Good Innovation Fund grant, at least one member should be affiliated to SUTD through either being an existing student, an alumnus or a past participant of SUTD programmes. Unsure if a past engagement qualifies? Write to us!
