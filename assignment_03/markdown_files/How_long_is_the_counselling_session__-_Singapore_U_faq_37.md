How long is the counselling session?
====================================

The first counselling session usually takes about 45 to 60 minutes. After the initial discussion, you and your Counsellor may decide on one of the options: – No further counselling is required at that particular moment in time – Further appointments are needed to explore the issues further – Alternative services are appropriate and your Counsellor may provide specific resources – The number of sessions may differ from case to case.
