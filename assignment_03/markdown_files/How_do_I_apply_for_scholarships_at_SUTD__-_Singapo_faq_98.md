How do I apply for scholarships at SUTD?
========================================

Information on [SUTD-administered scholarships can be found here](/admissions/undergraduate/scholarship/sutd-administered/). In your online application for admission, simply check the box in the section on Scholarships to indicate your interest to apply. If you have financial need, you may wish to improve your chances of securing a scholarship with a higher quantum of support by separately applying for financial aid (those enrolling in the immediate year will receive an email invite to apply for financial support upon receiving the admission offer notification).  
   
Students who demonstrate academic excellence, leadership qualities, special talents, good moral character and strong community spirit, could be recognised and rewarded with distinguished scholarships awarded by SUTD, generous donors and sponsor corporations.  
   
Do note that these scholarships are limited in numbers and are awarded on the basis of competition among eligible applicants. For International Students, scholarships generally cover up to the tuition fees for a Singapore Citizen.
