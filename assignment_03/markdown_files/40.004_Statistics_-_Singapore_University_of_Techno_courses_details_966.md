##### **Learning Objectives**

At the end of the term, students will be able to:

* Examine data and use tools to visualize the data to uncover relationships
* Develop estimates and confidence intervals from a data sample; perform hypotheses testing and goodness-of-fit tests
* Build a regression model and estimate the parameters, and perform a diagnosis on the quality and validity of the model
* Design an experiment and conduct analysis of variance for a multi-treatment sample

##### **Measurable Outcomes**
