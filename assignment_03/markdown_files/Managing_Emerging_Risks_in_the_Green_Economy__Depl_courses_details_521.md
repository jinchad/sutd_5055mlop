Overview
========

This workshop will provide participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to develop an effective Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) programme to manage sustainability risks. It will equip you with:

* an introduction and knowledge of key concepts in sustainability risks and fundamental elements of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) frameworks;
* an awareness of commonly used international ERM standards and sustainability frameworks, and the challenges and importance of green taxonomy; and
* the know-how to successfully integrate sustainability risks within an ERM framework for an improved ability to identify, assess, manage and report on sustainability risks to better align to the organisational objectives.

Participants will have ample opportunities to practise and apply the learnings in class through individual and group work. Participants will also gain insight to the challenges and practicalities of engaging stakeholders in managing emerging risks in the green economy.
