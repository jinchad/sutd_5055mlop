### Overview

The course is an introduction to classical Machine Learning technique using Python. It introduces learners to basic machine learning steps from data preparation to evaluation of machine learning models. Learners will learn and build two classical machine learning models namely Linear Regression and Logistic Regression for continuous and categorical data respectively. Learners will learn how to process data using Pandas library in Python as well as to visualize those data using Seaborn and Matplotlib. On top of that, they will write the functions to build machine learning models using NumPy. Instead of using Scikit-Learn Library, learners will write their own machine learning functions to gain deeper understanding how such library functions. At the end, they will learn some metrics to evaluate their machine learning models.
