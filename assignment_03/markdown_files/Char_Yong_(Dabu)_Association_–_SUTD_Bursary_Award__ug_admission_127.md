Like many Chinese associations in Singapore, the Association helped promote education in Singapore in the early days.   The Association is a strong advocator of education and believes that education can transform lives. The Char Yong (Dabu) Foundation was set up in 1995 with the purpose of managing the Association’s philanthropy work in education and promotion of Hakka and Chinese culture. |
