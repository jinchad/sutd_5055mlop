### Overview

##### **Modelling your career**

**Data-driven**. Now that’s a word you would have heard umpteen times and no wonder because the environments we work in are starting to look a lot like they are. From what to watch next on Netflix, to dynamic ticket pricing on airlines, organisations and businesses are using data-driven approaches to improve efficiencies and make critical decisions.

Learners can choose from a selection of relevant modular programmes offered by SUTD Academy, Singapore Polytechnic and Nanyang Polytechnic. These select courses ensure relevance and application to the industry, and offer a multi-faceted approach from different institutions to help busy professionals to attain the ModularMaster in Data Science credential.

##### **Course information**

These select courses offered by SUTD Academy ensure relevance and application to the industry, and offer a rigorous data science curriculum to help busy professionals to achieve the ModularMaster in Data Science credential. We are constantly designing and curating courses to the course list to ensure our curriculum remain relevant.

##### **Course structure and pathways**

**Programming track vs non-programme track**

We have designed two tracks to cater to participants with different learning preferences.

​Participants who prefer to make use of programming can go for the modules under the **Programming Track**while participants who prefer to make use of readily available tools can embark on modules under the **Non-Programming Track**.

For participants who do not possess a programming background, you may also take on a **Bridging Pathway** towards the **Programming Track**.

**Sam**, 35, is looking to transition into a data analyst or data scientist role. Currently an Engineer, Sam is proficient in Java programming and has some experience working with Python and is looking to put his eye for numbers into data science.

Sam is deciding between the Programming Track and Non-programming Track of the ModularMaster Certificate in Data Science programme. Which track should he choose?

---

Based on his learning objectives and aspiration to become a data analyst/scientist, together with his background and experience in programming; Sam would benefit most from going onboard the **Programming Track**.

The **Programming Track** is designed for learners who want to be able to perform data science tasks with the use of code, facilitating greater flexibility, and more expansive applications throughout the data science process.

**Usha**, 42, a stay-at-home mum is looking to return to work after 5 years. Previously a Marketing Associate, Usha is keen to learn data science because she has heard that it is a skill in demand, but Usha has no background in programming. She is keen to pursue a role as a business or market analyst.

Usha is deciding between the Programming Track and Non-programming Track of the ModularMaster Certificate in Data Science programme. Which track should she choose?

Based on her learning objectives and career goals; Usha would benefit most from going onboard the **Non-Programming Track**.

The **Non-Programming Track** is designed for learners who have no background in programming but with a strong interest in data science. This track allows such learners to acquire the skills and knowledge to navigate through the data science process with the use of tools and applications.

**Usman**, 26, a business graduate, is currently employed as a junior business analyst at a local manufacturing firm. His mentor has advised him to deepen his skills in data science to prepare him for career advancement. Usman has no background in programming but he regards it to be an important skillset should he want to progress in his career.

Usman is deciding between the Programming Track and Non-programming Track of the ModularMaster Certificate in Data Science programme. Which track should she choose?

---

Based on his learning objectives and career goals; Usman would benefit most from going onboard the **Programming Track**.

However, with no prior experience in programming, he may find it challenging to go directly for the Programming Track.

Usman can take on modules from the bridging track to gain the confidence and proficiency to prepare him for the **Programming Track**.

The **Non-Programming Track** is designed for learners who have no background in programming but with a strong interest in data science. This track allows such learners to acquire the skills and knowledge to navigate through the data science process with the use of tools and applications.
