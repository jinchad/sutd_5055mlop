This course provides a general outline of the history of architecture, urbanism and landscapes from early cultures to the present, spanning both western and non-western traditions. It is designed to develop critical tools to analyse and appreciate architecture for its role in creating the spatial environments in which we conduct our lives. Students analyse buildings and the built environment in relation to their contexts and histories of building technology. They assist in understanding and assimilating architectural terms and spatial concepts in the students’ formative years. Instruction and practice in oral and written communication formats are provided.

##### **Learning objectives**

1. The accumulation and appreciation of spatial types, terminology and vocabulary.
