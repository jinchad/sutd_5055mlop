Do_Tuition_Fee_Loan_(TFL)_and_Study_Loan_(SL)_cove



Do Tuition Fee Loan (TFL) and Study Loan (SL) cover full tuition fees for Singapore Permanent Residents (SPR) and International Students (IS)?
==============================================================================================================================================

No. TFL and SL will not cover the tuition fees of SPR and IS in full as the loan amount is capped at the subsidised tuition fees for Singapore Citizens (SC).
