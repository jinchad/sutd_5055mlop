Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

###### I did poorly for my A-Level exams. How can I increase my chances of admission into SUTD?

There are various alternative pathways for you to consider, including:

* Retaking your A-Levels; or
* Further your studies via the polytechnics, which offer module exemptions of up to two semesters for A-Level graduates in selected courses. These module exemptions allow A-Level graduates to graduate with a polytechnic diploma within 2 or 2.5 years, compared to the usual 3 years. More information on the application process and courses on offer can be found on the respective polytechnics’ websites

###### Can I still gain admission if I fail General Paper?

You may still apply even if you did not pass your General Paper. We will take into consideration your grades for other GCE A-Level subjects as well as non-academic credentials in assessing your application holistically.

---

###### Is Physics a compulsory subject for admission into SUTD?

Physics is not a compulsory subject for admission into SUTD. SUTD practises a comprehensive review of applications, where we consider all **academic** and **personal attributes** to assess if you are able to cope with the rigour of our programme and will fit in well.

For the former, we look for evidence of competency in Mathematics and the Sciences, i.e. Physics, Chemistry or Biology, in the context of the opportunities afforded to you based on your subject choices.

Apart from the final year exam results, we also take into consideration your academic performance in the 2-3 years leading to the final exam, including O-Levels, as well as any supplementary tests you may have taken.
