What should I do if I missed the main financial aid application?
================================================================

The main financial aid application cycle takes place once a year. However, there are also ad-hoc application cycles for the [Government Bursaries](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/financial-aid/government-bursaries/). Students will be notified on the application windows via email.



Eligible applicants are entitled to receive Government Bursaries only once in each academic year. **Reapplication is required every year.**



Students who have been awarded Government Bursaries under the main application cycle **do not** have to re-apply during the ad-hoc application cycles for the Government Bursaries within the same calendar year.
