Ethics_of_Leadership_-_Singapore_University_of_Tec



Ethics of Leadership
====================

This class will approach leadership and ethics from the perspective of two disciplines: management and philosophy. Ethics consider the interest of others; leadership deals with responsibilities incurred by using others for purposes beyond the scope of their intentions. Students will be introduced to the expectations of leadership and a range of ethical arguments in the performance of leadership. Relevant philosophic, narrative, managerial and local texts will be employed for discussion as well as case studies, particularly those from a Singaporean context.
