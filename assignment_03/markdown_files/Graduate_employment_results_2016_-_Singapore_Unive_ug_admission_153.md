The survey, as at 29 March 2017, revealed that more than nine in 10 SUTD fresh graduates were employed within six months of completing their final examinations despite a weaker economy. The mean gross monthly salary among SUTD’s fresh graduates employed in full-time permanent employment was $3,853 in 2016, compared to $3,709 in 2015. Some of the top hiring sectors include Information & Communication, Engineering Manufacturing, Financial & Insurance, and Public Administration & Defence.



“The SUTD graduates who joined CAG have performed beyond expectations. They demonstrate three distinct qualities. First, they are eager to learn, and take in advice from colleagues before developing solutions. Second, they are able to collaborate with colleagues across the entire value chain, and third, after creating solutions, they enable others to execute them. These qualities put them in good stead to deal with complex issues.”—**​ Yam Kum Weng, Executive Vice President, Airport Development of Changi Airport Group (CAG)**



246 graduates from SUTD were surveyed in Feb 2017 and the overall response rate obtained was 83.7%.
