If_the_Delivery_Order_(DO)_date_is_an_earlier_date



If the Delivery Order (DO) date is an earlier date (i.e., 1-Nov-2023) but there is no Goods Receipt (GR) yet, when I process the invoice at a later date (i.e., 6-Nov-2023), will your Finance team take my Tax Invoice dated 1-Nov-2023 or take the date we keyed in during the invoice processing (i.e., 6-Nov-2023)?
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Please check with the SUTD buyer/contact person if goods/services have been delivered. Please invoice us after SUTD has performed the GR. Invoice date to be used for submission in Ariba will be the date that corresponds to the attached invoice copy (in PDF format).
