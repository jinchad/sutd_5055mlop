When_I_generate_a_tax_invoice_by_our_own_system,_d



When I generate a tax invoice by our own system, do I need to submit that tax invoice in PDF format as an attachment?
=====================================================================================================================

Please attach a PDF copy of the official invoice as this will be used for verification and GST accounting purposes.

* Invoice Date: This will correspond to the date of your official invoice attached.
* Invoice Number: This will correspond to the invoice number on your official invoice attached, including special characters. If the invoice number exceeds 16 characters, please input the last 16 characters of your invoice number.
* Invoice Amount: Please ensure the total invoice amount (inclusive of GST, if applicable) in Ariba corresponds to your official invoice.
