How do I know if I am eligible for a UROP certificate?
======================================================

At the end of your UROP, you will be evaluated by your project supervisor. If your work is deemed satisfactory, your supervisor will recommend you for a UROP certificate. You will be notified to collect your certificate when it is ready. Participation will also be recorded in your Fifth Row transcript.
