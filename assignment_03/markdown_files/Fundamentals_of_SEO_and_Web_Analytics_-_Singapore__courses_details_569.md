Search Engine Optimisation or SEO is the process to help a website get ranked for targeted keywords, “organically” at a favourable position on search engines. This means websites which have master SEO get “found” easily by their customers.

This will be an extremely practical course as individuals/teams will have to deliver a plan that will be graded and this plan can be used as a template for their own organisation’s digital marketing plan.
