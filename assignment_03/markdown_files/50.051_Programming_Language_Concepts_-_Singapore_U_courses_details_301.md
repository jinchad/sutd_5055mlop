50.051 Programming Language Concepts
====================================

*Previously known as “50.new Secure Software Engineering”*

In this module, students will learn about data representation, programming and compilation. In the first part, we will learn how binary is used to encode values (data) and instructions (code). We will then learn how to create complex data types and how object oriented programming works behind the scenes. In the second part, we will work on the different aspects of compilation, including lexical and syntaxic analysis, parsing and programming language design. Students will complete four small projects (2 individual and 2 group assignments) about memory management in C, C++, and compilation (lexical and syntaxic analysis and parsing). By gaining this knowledge, students will be able to understand how programming languages are designed.
