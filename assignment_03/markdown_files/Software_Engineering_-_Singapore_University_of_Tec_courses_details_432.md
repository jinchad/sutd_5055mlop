### Overview

(Credit-bearing Programme)

The new digital world calls for software engineers who are able to work in a highly dynamic and fast-paced environment. This requires software engineers to be flexible, collaborative, innovative and courageous in challenging the norms and traditional approaches.

Hence, software engineers have to be equipped with methods, workflows and tools to handle increasingly complex software development projects and work as a team to deliver high-quality software in short development cycles. In this course, participants will learn to work in teams to apply some best practices in software engineering such as Agile software development method, Git Workflows, secure software engineering process, software testing basics and sprint review.

**Earn Subject Units as you learn**  
After completing this programme, participants are also awarded 12 SC (Subject Credits) which can be used to complete relevant degree programmes at SUTD. Successful participants will receive a Certificate of Completion and transcript from SUTD.
