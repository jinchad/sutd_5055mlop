Overview
========

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Technology and Management](/repo/course/modularmaster-in-technology-and-management/ "ModularMasters in Technology and Management") programme**

During the past twenty years, digital design and manufacturing technology has become indispensable in many and various applications world-wide; involving many products and rapidly expanding markets. It has not only provided industry with new methods, tools and digitalised products – from design, materials processing to operating and management procedures – but is also changing the approaches, thinking patterns and working environments of people in the manufacturing field.

This module provides exposure to a range of current and future industry processes and practices that require extensive use of digital intelligence. It gives an integrated perspective on design, engineering, and management principles in digitalisation of manufacturing enterprises. Students can also learn about the design and fabrication of parts using digital fabrication technologies such as Additive Manufacturing (aka 3D printing), Digital Sheet Cutters (e.g. laser cutters) and Fusion 360 (for regenerative design). Topics include Design for Manufacturing, Digital Manufacturing Systems, Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, Digital Twin, and Advanced Manufacturing Techniques (including AI in Advanced Manufacturing).
