I_have_received_and_accepted_SUTD’s_undergraduate_



I have received and accepted SUTD’s undergraduate admissions offer. Does my relevant diploma (e.g. Diploma in Nanotechnology and Materials Science), give me a higher chance of enrolling in EPD?

Students enrolled in SUTD’s undergraduate programme will start year 1 with our common Freshmore curriculum. You are only required to select your choice of major (or degree) at the end of Term 3. The qualification you have used during admissions application will not be referenced at this point. Based on past statistics, most students will be confirmed for your choice of major.
