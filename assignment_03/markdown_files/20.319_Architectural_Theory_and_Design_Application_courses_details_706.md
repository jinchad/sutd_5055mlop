The process upon which contemporary twentieth and twenty-first century-architects design, draw, write, and build is the focus of this course. The concomitant discourse amongst critics, the resulting scholarly critique, and the written design statement is a reflection of a complex set of values, hierarchies, and judgement criteria. This course’s goal is to deconstruct the embedded and often at times hidden sets of values that influence the creation of architecture and govern its design, construction, production, use, and occasional demise. Students will emerge from this course with a thorough understanding of modern canonical design philosophies in conjunction with a more concise understanding of what forces govern the growth and development of their nascent design ethos.

##### **Learning objectives**

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Understand the concepts supporting contemporary critical architectural theories;
* Apply contemporary criteria to analyse movements in the past eighty years of architectural theory;
