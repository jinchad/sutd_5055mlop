02.102HT The World Since 1400
=============================

This class surveys the social, economic, and political change that societies and cultures have experienced from the year 1400 to the present. Its primary theme is exchange, or the nature of interaction between communities as barriers of distance have succumbed to curiosity and new communications technologies. Among the key issues the course covers, is the unexpected rise of Western Europe and the United States during the past 500 years, the “great divergence” in material, political, and technological development that occurred between Western Europe and Asia after 1750, and the resulting impact on the rest of the world.

The course presents history in an integrative fashion, examining processes, trends, and environmental factors at the trans-regional or global level rather than presenting a series of histories of different regions in sequence. It seeks to accomplish this by emphasizing the material, cultural, and intellectual exchanges that have taken place between different regions, societies, and civilizations. In the process, the class will examine a series of ever-shifting relationships, those between human beings and their physical environment, between different religious and political systems, between ethnic groups, and between men and women. The comparative study of these relationships will play a crucial role in illustrating major patterns in history. This course will also serve as an introduction to historical and other interpretive methodologies, as students will be expected to analyze and interpret both primary and secondary source materials.
