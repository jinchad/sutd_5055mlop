May I apply to a company that is not represented on the portal?
===============================================================

Yes, you are free to source for your own internship with a company of your choosing. However, for an internship to be recognised, it will need to be approved by the Career Development Centre.



If you are applying for an internship on your own (without using the portal), you will need to write to us at careers@sutd.edu.sg and provide the following details:



* Name of the organisation
* Contact person of the organisation
* Contact details of the company


For an internship to be officially recognised, it will need to at least meet the following criteria:



* Duration of the internship (must be 16 weeks)
* Relevance of the field of work to your course / programme


The Career Development Centre must be informed at least 1 month before the official starting date.



Please note that the above criteria are just the basic guidelines, and any internship may still be rejected on other grounds.
