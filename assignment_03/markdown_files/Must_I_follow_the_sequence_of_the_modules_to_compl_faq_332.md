Must I follow the sequence of the modules to complete the ModularMaster programme?
==================================================================================

You do not have to follow a specific sequence for majority of the modules in order to complete the ModularMaster Certificate Programme. You can take individual modules at your own pace. However, the programme must be completed within a 2-year candidature period. To earn the ModularMaster Certificate, all required modules under the specific domain must be completed within this timeframe.
