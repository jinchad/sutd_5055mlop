Integrated Learning Programme (ILP)
===================================

### Overview



The Integrated Learning Programme (ILP) is a bridging programme unique to SUTD that aims to provide a review on basic mathematical and science concepts for university courses as well as basic coding and programming skills so as to smoothen the transitional experience of students.

#### **Course outline**



##### ILP Mathematics, ILP Physics, ILP Chemistry and ILP Biology



The main objective of these classes is to introduce the basic mathematical and science concepts which are necessary for the first year undergraduate courses in SUTD. The topics covered are as follows:



* **Mathematics:** real numbers, sets, equations, inequalities, functions, polynomial and rational functions, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, polar coordinates and parametric equations, vectors in 2D and 3D, sequences and series, limits, differentiation and integration.
* **Physics:** kinematics; Newton’s laws of motion; work done and energy; impulse and momentum; uniform circular motion; torque; fundamentals of thermal physics; fundamentals of electromagnetics.


* **Chemistry:** chemical and physical properties of the elements; periodic trends; stoichiometry; chemical bonds; chemical and electrochemical reaction; thermodynamic properties.


* **Biology:** cells and organelles, biological macromolecules (carbohydrate, lipid, protein, and nucleic acid), information flow in living system, biodiversity and evolution.


##### ILP Computing



The module is specially designed to provide basic coding and programming skills.  The topics covered are as follows:



* Introduction to concepts: programming, coding, algorithms, languages, architecture
* Coding in Python, using a text editor, a console, and a programming environment
* Variables, variables types, mathematical expressions, comments, print() and input() functions.
* Basic booleans and functions
* Importing functions from basic libraries
* Memory states in functions
* Conditional structures, While loops, and infinite loops
* For loops on lists, for loops on generators (range(), zip(), enumerate()), nested for loops and advanced loop structures, breaking loops, recursion, and the list type
* Assertions, tests and error messages
* Debugging practices and typical mistakes in programming
* The Numpy library and Numpy array type, the string type, the tuple type and the set type
* Introduction to object-oriented thinking
* Randomness in Numpy and stochastic programming
* Handling time in Python


##### **How to register?**



Students who have signed up for Early Matriculation 2025 (both spring and summer) will receive an official email and registration link from the Office of Admissions by mid-June 2025 to register for ILP.
