Programme structure
===================

The programme duration is:

* **8 terms** for Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) or Bachelor of Science (BSc); or
* **10 terms** for the concurrent BEng and Master of Engineering (MEng) pathway.

Students who wish to pursue further postgraduate studies may apply to our [PhD](/admissions/graduate/phd/) programmes.

##### **Honours sessions**

To equip SHARP students with research methodology and to deepen their subject domain knowledge, advanced classes (known as honours sessions) will be offered on top of the regular [Freshmore subjects](/education/undergraduate/freshmore-subjects/) in Terms 1 to 3.

##### **Research**

From Terms 4 to 8, you will conduct an undergraduate research project with one or more faculty members, which will lead to an undergraduate thesis in Term 8.

For students who continue in the **Concurrent BEng-MEng Degree Pathway (CDP)**, you will extend the research project to Term 10, and complete the requirements of the Master of Engineering (MEng) by Research.

##### **Global research exposure**

During the term breaks, you will participate in an overseas summer programme and a research internship respectively. An optional short overseas field trip will be held during the Independent Activity Period (IAP) in Term 5.

##### **Concurrent BEng-MEng Degree Pathway (CDP)**

The Concurrent BEng-MEng Degree Pathway (CDP)allows selected SHARP students with excellent research performance to extend their research project to Term 10 (two more terms), while completing the requirements of existing MEng (Research) degree. In the CDP, selected students will be enrolled as BEng students from Term 1 to 6, and continue as concurrent BEng and MEng students from Term 7 to 10.

Only selected SHARP students pursuing the **Computer Science and Design (CSD)**, **Engineering Product Development (EPD)** or **Engineering Systems and Design (ESD)** degree programmes are eligible for application to CDP.
