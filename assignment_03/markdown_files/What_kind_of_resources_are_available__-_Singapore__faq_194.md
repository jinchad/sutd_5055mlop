What kind of resources are available?
=====================================

We have a range of programmes and incubation-exclusive events that are open to all incubatees. Incubatees can also tap on our network of mentors, industry experts and investors. We have heard that the number-one-most-beneficial resource is the network access and guidance that we provide to our incubatees, which have considerably shaped and driven their start-up development.
