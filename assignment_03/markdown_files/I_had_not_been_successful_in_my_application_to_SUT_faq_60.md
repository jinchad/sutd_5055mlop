I_had_not_been_successful_in_my_application_to_SUT



I had not been successful in my application to SUTD in the last admissions exercise. Can I apply again this year with the same results?
=======================================================================================================================================

You will not be penalised for re-applying in the new admissions exercise and your new application will be assessed in competition with the pool of applicants applying this time round.Â However, we do recommend that you consider supplementing your new application with additional relevant information not presented previously to improve your chances of being considered for admission.
