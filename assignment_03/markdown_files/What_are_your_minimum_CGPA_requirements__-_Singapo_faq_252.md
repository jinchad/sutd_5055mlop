What are your minimum CGPA requirements?
========================================

We do not impose a minimum CGPA requirement, as we evaluate all applications on a comprehensive basis. Beyond your CGPA, we also consider how you performed in relevant subjects, e.g. Engineering/ComputingÂ Mathematics.



Your grades in the advanced modules will also be taken into consideration. You should also possess a good pass in your Additional Mathematics and Science subjects, i.e. Physics or Chemistry, in the GCE O-Level or equivalent qualification.
