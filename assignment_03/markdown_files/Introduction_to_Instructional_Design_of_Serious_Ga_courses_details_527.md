### Overview

Serious games are those that serve a goal other than pure enjoyment, such as teaching, raising awareness, training, advertising, or any other “serious” objective that can be motivated by the compelling environment that games offer. In the past, serious games have frequently been employed in the fields of education, training, healthcare, finance and defence. Serious games, which can use a variety of gaming technologies to support or aid in an individual’s training or the development of an industry as a whole, are defined as the junction between learning, simulation, and gaming. Serious games encourage players to maximize their own performance by combining more interactive learning with the strength of competition and a sense of accomplishment.

In this programme, participants will study the fundamentals of serious games, which are created with precisely these goals in mind. This programme will define serious games and talk about the varying kinds that have been created. We will discuss the appeal of playing them as well as any potential effects. Participants will learn how serious games function and how players are drawn to them using cutting‐edge concepts from game studies and case studies of serious games created from various industry. Finally, participants will be introduced to various tools required for the assessment and validation framework for serious games.
