### Programme Outline

##### **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this course, participants should be able to / can expect to:

* Understand and apply the fundamental HR data analytics building blocks and linking them to the core business;
* Learn about the robust methods for data collection
* Interpret a mix of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics tools, as well as causal inference techniques;
* Learn about basic coding skills and machine learning for manipulating swaths of data;
* Understand data-driven story telling approaches for developing a narrative that makes sense for your business leaders;
* Prepare, analyse and identify business insights for elevating the impact of HR to your organisation’s success.

Participants will also get to work on practical HR problems using machine learning techniques. These problems include

* Employee Turnover Analysis using Logistic Regression

##### Day 4

**Intermediate Data Storytelling**  
Under the intermediate data storytelling, the emphasis is on deriving insights from visuals and putting the visuals together in a dashboard.

* Data vs Insights – Data Science Lifecycle and DIKW Pyramid
* Insights from Visuals – Exploratory Data Analysis (Techniques)
* Enhanced SPSN
* Dashboard – Design and Considerations
* Individual Quiz

This is a quick, practical introduction to PowerBI. At the end of this session, participants should:

* Understand additional PowerBI elements that enhance user interactivity
* Have exposure to basic Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
* Be able to create visuals with dynamic features
* Know how to put together a dashboard to tell a story

This course does not cover programming or advanced DAX formulas and leverages on knowledge and pre-work done during PowerBI fundamentals.

**Contents**

* Applying filters and drill-throughs
* Binning and grouping
