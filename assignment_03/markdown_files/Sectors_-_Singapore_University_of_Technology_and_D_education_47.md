### SUTD Growth Plan



We have set aside a multi-million dollar budget to spearhead our next phase of growth in three key economic sectors (**Aviation**, **Cities**, and **Healthcare**) supported by capabilities in **Artificial Intelligence/Data Science**. We will work with industry to develop a suite of integrated, multi-disciplinary programmes to enhance SUTD’s education and research offerings, to prepare our graduates for the future economy, and to support national growth priorities.  
  
Initiatives will include research collaborations to develop state-of-the-art technologies and capabilities to support industry transformation, in-depth faculty-staff learning and training exchanges, co-development of specialised, skills-based courses, access to advanced facilities and equipment for teaching, learning, and research, and enhanced internship and mentorship programmes focusing on job placements, innovation and entrepreneurship.  
  
“SUTD’s next phase will be big and bold – in both vision and ambition. With our innovative education, multi-disciplinary research and pervasive partnerships with industry, government and global universities, we will deliver a truly unique and exciting university experience for our students to create a better world by design. We will continue to produce technically grounded leaders and innovators to meet the challenges of Singapore and the world.” – Professor Chong Tow Chong, President, SUTD  
  
We have also put together different subjects to offer students the flexibility to build their portfolio in these sectors.



##### **Aviation**



![](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aviation.png)  
Singapore is an international air traffic hub. Air passenger traffic is expected to grow, and the Singapore Changi Airport is set to double in size with the addition of Terminal 5. Singapore is also an aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul hub. There are great career prospects in Aviation. Airlines, airports, air traffic control and engineering services must innovate to increase productivity and keep pace with the growth. Airports are also one of the most complex engineering systems and skills developed in mastering the complexity of airport design and operation is important and readily applicable to other engineering systems. SUTD‘s interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary nature of our curriculum and research and the disruptive nature of digital technologies is our value proposition for aviation.

##### **Cities**



![](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cities.png)  
Cities will be the leading focus of governments, universities, think tanks and non-profit groups in the coming years and decades. By 2050, 75% of the world will be living in cities and megacities. In Asia, urbanization is a major trend. Six of the top ten largest cities are in Asia. All will be encountering major urban challenges which include housing/density, traffic/transport, connectivity, flooding, clean water, energy and climate change and job creation. SUTD as the most multidisciplinary university in Singapore is well-positioned to undertake research in these problems in ASEAN’s cities and seek solutions to these urban challenges.

##### **Healthcare**



![](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Healthcare.png)  
Like many developed countries, Singapore faces the daunting challenges with its aging population and the need to re-invent its healthcare system to deliver patient-centric and cost-effective care through sustainable technology-enabled solutions. SUTD will use design thinking to advance healthcare innovation and provide technology-enabled solutions to a wide range of pressing healthcare challenges.  
  
SUTD is education and research partner to almost 20 leading healthcare institutions.

##### **Artificial Intelligence/Data Science**



![](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AI.jpg)  
Smart Nation is Singapore’s vision to be an economically competitive global city and a liveable home. It is a movement to harness digital technologies to build a future Singapore. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be one of the key enablers to achieve the Smart Nation vision. AI is fast becoming a large part of our everyday life. It is the key technology in many applications like facial recognition, image classifications and chatbots. As AI technology progresses, AI will permeate into many other industries like architecture, city planning, logistics and aviation. SUTD aims to look beyond near-term solutions and develop transformative AI capabilities for the long term.  
  
In order to prepare students for the digital economy as the world gears towards a Fourth Industrial Revolution, all SUTD students will be equipped with knowledge in artificial intelligence/data science (AI/DS).  
   
This is achieved through the incorporation of various AI/DS topics throughout the course curriculum, regardless of their chosen major. Students interested to acquire deeper knowledge in AI/DS may also choose to take up an [AI Minor](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/minor/) or an [AI Track](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/tracks/artificial-intelligence).
