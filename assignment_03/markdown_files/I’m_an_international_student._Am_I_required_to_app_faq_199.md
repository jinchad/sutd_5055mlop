I’m an international student. Am I required to apply for a Student Pass and when can I do so?
=============================================================================================

International Students who have accepted SUTD’s admission offer will need to apply for a Student’s Pass (STP). This can only be done not more than 2 months before the commencement of course. You will need to submit STP application to the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) as soon as possible upon receiving the registration details from SUTD via email. Successful applicants will receive an In-Principle Approval for STP (STP-IPA).  
   
If you are a Dependant’s Pass (DP) holder, you are still required to apply for an STP. However, if the duration of the course is shorter than the duration of the DP, you may opt to be issued a Letter of Consent (LOC) to study in SUTD. As a DP holder requesting for an LOC to study in SUTD, you must indicate your intention in the remarks column in the ICA eForm16.
