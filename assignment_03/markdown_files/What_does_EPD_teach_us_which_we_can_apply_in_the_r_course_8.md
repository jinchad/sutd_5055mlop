What does EPD teach us which we can apply in the real world?
============================================================

Real world problems are complex, vague and multi-facetted; thus, requiring skilled people from different domains and disciplines to work together to create functional and effective solutions. Our broad-based education at SUTD equips students with a wide scope of understanding of different disciplines that will allow them to serve as an effective bridge between fields. Our rigorous academic EPD curriculum grounds them with the required fundamental theories that students can subsequently build on and expand. Through design projects, EPD students learn to work in cross-functional and multidisciplinary teams and apply their expertise whilst actively contributing towards designing and developing effective engineering solutions.
