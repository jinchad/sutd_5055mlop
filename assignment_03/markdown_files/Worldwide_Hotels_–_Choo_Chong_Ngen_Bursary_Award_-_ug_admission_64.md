| Mr Choo Chong Ngen, the Chairman of Worldwide Hotels Group, is a strong advocate of education, with the belief that financial constraints should not bar talented individuals from pursuing their education aspirations. In line with this vision, he founded the Worldwide Hotels – Choo Chong Ngen Foundation to help less privileged students pursue higher education. To date, more than $14 million has been donated to local universities, polytechnics, and institutes of technical education to establish bursaries. In celebration of Worldwide Hotels Group’s 30th Anniversary celebrations in April 2024, the Foundation donated $2 million to the Singapore University Technology and Design (SUTD), further enabling students to achieve their dreams without financial barriers. |
