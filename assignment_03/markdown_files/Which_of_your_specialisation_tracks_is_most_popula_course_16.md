Which of your specialisation tracks is most popular and why?
============================================================

Generally, [Mechanical](/epd/education/undergraduate/specialisation-tracks/mechanical-engineering/), [Electrical](/epd/education/undergraduate/specialisation-tracks/electrical-engineering/) and [Self-Directed](/epd/education/undergraduate/specialisation-tracks/self-directed-programme/) are the 3 more popular tracks. Recently, [Healthcare Engineering Design](/epd/education/undergraduate/specialisation-tracks/healthcare-engineering-design/) and [Robotics](/epd/education/undergraduate/specialisation-tracks/robotics/) are also gaining popularity. It is difficult to point to any one specific reason, since there are various reasons for the popularity (studentâ€™s choices, preferences, market forces etc.).
