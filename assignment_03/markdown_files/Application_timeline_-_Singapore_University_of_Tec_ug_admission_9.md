Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

###### Is it necessary to take Physics major at Year 6 for admission to SUTD?

It is not necessary to undertake Physics major at Year 6 for admission to SUTD. We also consider other Sciences as relevant subjects for evaluation of admission to SUTD.

---

###### What is the minimum CAP score for admissions?

We do not impose a minimum CAP score requirement as we practise a comprehensive review of applications where we consider all **academic** and **personal attributes** to assess if you are able to cope with the rigour of our programme and will fit in well in SUTD.

On the academic aspect, beyond your CAP, we also consider how you performed in the relevant subjects, e.g. Mathematics and the Sciences. Students who took Majors with Honours in the relevant subjects will be considered favourably. You should also possess a good pass in the relevant subjects at Year 4.
