### Overview

Futures Thinking entails exploring possible future scenarios based on our understanding of the current realities and future trends. Importantly, the process prompts critical reflect on envisioned future scenarios, helping us to answer questions like: What should the future look like? What values and assumptions underly the envisioned future? and Who would benefit the most? Identifying preferred scenarios is key to developing strategies for achieving those futures.

Nevertheless, most people will not actively consider the above questions and even fewer would plan for the future while their immediate circumstances are more wanting. This phenomenon does not bode well as our society grapples with wicked problems that would, first and foremost, require individuals think beyond their ‘here and now’ if we were to have a chance at tackling them.

Taking an inquiry approach, this course will acquaint the participants with the practice of Futures Thinking and give them pointers on how to similarly guide others in the practice. It will be grounded in insights from the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities’ (LKYCIC) cutting-edge transdisciplinary research on relevant future trends and scenarios.
