#### **Professor Tai Lee Siang**

Deputy President-Designate and Head of Pillar, Architecture and Sustainable Design (ASD) Director, DesignZ, and Programme Director, Design and Artificial Intelligence, Singapore University of Technology and Design

Lee Siang graduated with honours from NUS in 1987 and has practiced as an architect and urban planner since 1990. He started his career as an urban designer with the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 1990. Subsequently, he joined DP Architects in 1992 and became a partner in 2000. Between 2011 to 2016, Lee Siang joined Ong&Ong Group, a multi-discipline design firm as Group Managing Director. In 2018, Building & Construction Authority invited Lee Siang to assume the position of Executive Director, BuildSG to spearhead industry engagement. His role was expanded to include Communication and Engagement in 2020. In 2021, Lee Siang is appointed by Singapore University of Technology & Design to be the Head of Pillar, Architecture and Sustainable Design (ASD).

Lee Siang is most passionate about voluntary works on the NGOs fronts. In the 10 years between 2007 and 2018, he was elected president for 3 trade associations and chairman for 1 global NGO. The organisations are :

* ​Singapore Institute of Architects, President 2007 – 2009
* Singapore Green Building Council, President 2011 – 2013
* Design Business Chamber Singapore, President 2012 – 2016

#### **Assistant Professor Frederick Peter Ortner**

Assistant Professor,Architecture and Sustainable Design  
Singapore University of Technology and Design

Peter is Assistant Professor and MArch and PhD Coordinator for Architecture and Sustainable Design at SUTD. His research leverages computational techniques to create sustainable architecture and urban design. His current research introduces optimisation into the process of design for circularity, augmenting the ability of the architect to contribute to zero-waste, carbon neutral cities. Predicting urban metabolism data for urban design scenarios is another on-going research pursuit. In recent research, he has applied computational design to challenges of urban resilience and automated mobility. His doctoral research built on insights from critical data studies and computational design to elucidate the changing role of architecture and architect in complex, data-driven urban systems.

Peter received a PhD from EPFL where his doctoral thesis was nominated for the EPFL and City of Lausanne prizes. At EPFL he was a collaborator with Media x Design Lab, a cross-disciplinary team of designers and computer scientists. He holds a Master’s degree in Architecture from Harvard University where he was recipient of the Faculty Design Award, and a Bachelor of Arts cum laude with distinction in Architecture from Yale University. He has practiced architecture in the United States and Switzerland.

#### **D****r Zheng Kai**

Lecturer, Architecture and Sustainable Design  
Singapore University of Technology and Design

Zheng Kai is a Lecturer in the Architecture and Sustainable Design pillar at SUTD. He obtained his Doctoral and Bachelor’s degrees from the National University of Singapore. His work investigates how evaporative cooling can be deployed in building design to achieve Thermal Comfort for the Tropics and his interests also lie in how architectural energy systems can work in synergy. Other works also include pandemic resilient architecture and systems to improve Building Wellness and health. He is an Accredited Professional for the BCA Green Mark and the WELL Building Standard (IWBI).
