How_are_students_assigned_to_their_rooms__What_if_



How are students assigned to their rooms? What if I am not comfortable with my assigned roommate?
=================================================================================================

Freshmore students are paired in double rooms according to the class/cluster they are assigned to. Students complete a lifestyle questionnaire as part of the housing acceptance process, and will be matched with roommates of similar lifestyle habits as far as possible.  
   
As both you and your roommate embark on your university journey, with time you will discover each other’s interests, strengths and quirks, as well as how to support and cheer each other on in this new environment. Do approach the Office of Housing at [ecchousing@sutd.edu.sg](mailto:ecchousing@sutd.edu.sg) should you need our help to resolve any differences.
