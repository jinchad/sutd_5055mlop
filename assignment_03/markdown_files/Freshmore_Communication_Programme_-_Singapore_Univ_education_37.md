All First-year students undergo a mandatory Freshmore Communication Programme (FCP). Students are understandably anxious about the prospects of churning out an academic paper in their freshmore classes. Imagine having to write a critique about the social theories of Emile Durkheim or a literary criticism of Rabindranath Tagore’s plays. The CWR has devised a no fuss six weeks crash course to ease the writing woes of our new students. Designed in close collaboration with HASS faculty, this course helps students reflect on their writing processes in writing journals and obtain critical aid from the CWR in drafting their assignments.
