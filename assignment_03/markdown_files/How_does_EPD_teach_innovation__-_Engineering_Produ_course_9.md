How does EPD teach innovation?
==============================

There is no single method to teach ‘innovation’. Innovation is a culture and pedagogy in our teaching, which is embedded in many courses that EPD offers as well as [5th row activities](/campus-life/student-life/student-organisations-fifth-row/) (e.g., entrepreneurship competitions or entrepreneurship capstone projects).
