How does DAI Differ from other SUTD degree Programmes?
======================================================

DAI focuses on using AI to “better design” with an emphasis on application-based courses and design studios where students will work on real-world data via company-sponsored projects.




Apart from our focus in Design and AI topics, DAI has 4 design studios where students have to work on real-world challenges via company-sponsored projects. Hence, there is a lot of hands-on experiential learning at DAI.
