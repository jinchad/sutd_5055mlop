Overview
========

Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) is an emerging technology that has wide areas of industrial, commercial as well as consumer applications. This course seeks to provide participants with technical understanding of contemporary UAS technology and its subcomponents. Both commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) as well as do-it-yourself (DIY) systems will be examined. In addition, due to increasing use of UAS, detection and counter-UAS approaches will also be explored.
