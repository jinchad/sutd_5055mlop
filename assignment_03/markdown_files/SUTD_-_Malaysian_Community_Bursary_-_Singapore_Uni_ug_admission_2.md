| **THIS BURSARY AWARD IS ESTABLISHED IN MEMORY OF THE LATE MDM LIM PU LEH.**   The late Mdm Lim was widowed at an early age and forced to work to raise three young children. Being illiterate, she took on hard labour jobs such as washerwoman, domestic helper and caretaker of association premises. Money was never enough and she taught her children to be thrifty and frugal. Through her hard work and enterprise, she was able to bring up a strong family, inculcated with good values of giving and sharing. Her children were very dependent on financial aid provided by clan association, schools and university. She was an excellent role model : accept challenges, work hard, be thrifty and yet be generous and helpful to others.    This bursary is set up by her children as their contribution to give back to the community in memory of their beloved mother. To remember their Malaysian roots, the donors have requested that the annual awards be given to financially challenged students from Malaysia where possible. |
