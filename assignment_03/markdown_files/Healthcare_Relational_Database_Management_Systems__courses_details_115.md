### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science (Healthcare)](/course/modularmaster-in-data-science-healthcare/ "ModularMasters in Data Science") programme**

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) play a crucial role in the initial stage of the data science lifecycle, providing a strong foundation for effective data management and setting the stage for successful data analysis. With RDBMS, data professionals can efficiently handle large volumes of data, ensuring its integrity, consistency, and easy accessibility. The optimized storage, retrieval, and maintenance processes offered by database management systems enhance overall data management efficiency. Additionally, by mastering SQL queries, data professionals can streamline data pre-processing within the database system, ensuring a certain level of data quality before analysis and simplifying the exploratory phase of data analysis projects. Moreover, their understanding of efficient database design, data import, and integration from diverse sources enables seamless data integration, ensuring data consistency and integrity, and facilitating analysis, reporting, and visualization processes.

This course, spanning a duration of five days, is specifically designed to equip participants with the skills in designing, accessing and managing databases using RDBMS tools. Participants will be actively involved in a healthcare-related project throughout the module. The final day, which is split into two half-days on separate weeks, will be dedicated to project consultation and project presentation.
