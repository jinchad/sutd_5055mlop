###### Is either SAT or IELTS score submission compulsory for admission? Is there any minimum requirement?

Submission of either IELTS, TOEFL, SAT, Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), ACT scores or C1 Advanced is compulsory for applicants who are presenting qualifications where English is not the medium of instruction.

There is no prescribed minimum score as your application will be reviewed comprehensively based on both academic and non-academic achievements.
