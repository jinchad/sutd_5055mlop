### Programme Outline



Participants will do a simple project based on the common Neural network model with Weka.

##### **Learning Objectives**

* Understand what is AI
* Understand Machine Learning
* Understand Deep Learning
* Data Analytics

##### Part 1 – The intuition of AI

* In this workshop, we explore the derivative of what empower some of the most common AI solutions. Participants will have a hands-on basic artificial neural network with Weka as part of their classification task.

##### Part 2 – Introduction to Text Mining Works

* Participants will be able to appreciate some ideas of NLP implementations, in particular text mining where it could be prevalent in either speech or cybersecurity at a high-level context.

##### Part 3 – Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence

* Handwriting is a ubiquitous form of art which is unique to an individual. At a high-level, participants will appreciate the mechanism behind some of the more intriguing form of art and how one capitalises on handwriting to predict what digit he is writing.

##### Part 4 – Image Recognition with Artificial Intelligence

* Image and facial recognition are some of the more advanced and complicated AI technology that man has ever explored. At a high-level, we will explore the mechanism image processing works and the participants will also be shown with a realia of a simple IoT device that can empower a common facial recognition.

##### Assessment

* Participants will do a simple project based on the common Neural network model with Weka.
