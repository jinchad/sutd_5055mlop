### Criteria for Admission

You should have completed at least 12 years of general education or have taken the Year 12 national/international examination in the year of application in order to be considered for admission. Students with strong competency in Mathematics and the Sciences, i.e. Physics or Chemistry, are generally preferred.

##### **Mother Tongue Language (MTL)**

All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are required to fulfil the MTL requirement for admission into full-time publicly-funded undergraduate programmes in the universities.

The MTL requirement may be fulfilled through the following:

1. a D7 grade for Higher MTL at Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level (the iGCSE MTL First Language examination does not fulfil the requirement); or
2. a pass in MTL ‘B’ or a S grade for H1 MTL/ MTL-in-lieu or H2 MTL Language and Literature or H1 General Studies in Chinese at Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level; or
3. a pass in MTL A: Literature, or MTL A: Language and Literature, or Language B MTL at Standard or Higher Level at International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (the IB Standard Level Language ab initio does not fulfil the requirement).

Those who have not fulfilled the MTL requirement may still apply for admission with no prejudice to their application. However, if accepted, they will be required to fulfil the MTL requirement during their course of study.

Applicants who have been away from Singapore’s school system for some years and have not kept up with the study of their MTL or a language that can be offered as MTL-in-lieu may apply for MTL exemption. The MTL exemption application will be facilitated by the universities as part of the university application, and the results made known to applicants who receive admission offers from the university. Please note that MOE does not accept direct applications for MTL exemption. The application for MTL exemption will also not prejudice the evaluation of the application for a place in the university.

##### **English Proficiency requirement**
