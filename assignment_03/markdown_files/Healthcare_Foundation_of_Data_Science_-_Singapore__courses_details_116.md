This course, spanning a duration of five days, is specifically designed to equips participants with valuable skills in data analysis and communication in healthcare context. Over the first four days, participants will explore how to analyse healthcare data, perform statistical tests, and communicate important findings to different audiences. Using real-life healthcare scenarios and advanced tools, participants will develop skills to draw meaningful conclusions and contribute to evidence-based decision-making. Participants will be actively involved in a healthcare-related project throughout the module. The final day, which is split into two half-days on separate weeks, will be dedicated to project consultation and project presentation.
