### Programme Outline



##### **Learning Objectives and Structure**

By the end of the course, participants will:

* be able to create their own custom GPTs tailored to their unique tasks and needs
* be able to leverage custom GPTs to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their specific work tasks, streamlining workflows and increasing productivity
* gain practical skills in deploying their custom GPT within their work environment for seamless integration and optimal benefit for individuals as well as for the organisation as a whole
* integrate what they have learned into strategies for their workforces and organizations to ensure they are prepared for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) age

##### Day 1

* Introduction and overview of the course objectives and outcomes
* What are custom GPTs, and why they are a window into Design x AI x Tech, and the Future of AI (e.g. agents)
* Hands-on practice — designing and building your own custom GPTs to improve performance at work
* Strategic implications — what strategies within organisations are are needed given what they have learned from the above
* Synthesis: what research and practice are telling us about the future of work in the age of AI
* Strategies: given the Synthesis above, and the Strategic Implications from the morning, what are the “simple rules” for future of work strategies to naivgate an exponential, unexpected, and human-centered future
* Systems: how do we comhine different strategies to create new systems to redesign jobs for mastery and meaning in the workforce
* Synthess II: discussion and distillation of the action steps they can take back and implement immediately withinin their organisations

##### Assessment

Class participation and in-class project presentation.
