“SUTD students have been carefully nurtured within SUTD’s multi-disciplinary technology and design ecosystem to hone their critical thinking and problem solving skills. By equipping every student with industry experience through internships, coupled with overseas exposure to provide them with a global perspective, SUTD graduates are industry-, region- and future-ready. We are pleased that for the third consecutive year, employers continue to recognise these invaluable qualities, and our graduates continue to enjoy a high employment rate and starting salary.”—​ **Professor Chong Tow Chong, SUTD’s Acting President and Provost**



228 graduates from SUTD were surveyed in Feb 2018 and the overall response rate obtained was 85.4%.
