As of 15 March 2016, almost 90% of SUTD’s engineering graduates are employed. A high percentage found themselves rewarding jobs in Singapore’s key industries, such as aviation and aerospace engineering, banking and finance, infocomm services and research and development. The high starting salaries signal a strong vote of confidence from employers that the education acquired at SUTD is highly valuable. SUTD equips students for real world challenges through a world-class design-centric education built upon an interdisciplinary hands-on curriculum and cohort-based learning approach.



“I recruit from the best schools across US like MIT and University of Chicago. The SUTD students are as good as any, I have seen and hired.”

298 graduates from SUTD were surveyed in Feb 2016 and the overall response rate obtained was 86.2%.
