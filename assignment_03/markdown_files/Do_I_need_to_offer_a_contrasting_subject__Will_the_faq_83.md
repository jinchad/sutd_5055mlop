Do I need to offer a contrasting subject? Will the contrasting subject be considered in the UAS?
================================================================================================

Yes, there is no change to the contrasting subject requirement at the GCE A-Level examinations. Students will be required to offer four content-based A-Level subjects of which at least three must be H2 subjects, and at least one must be a contrasting subject from outside their area of specialisation (i.e., subject from the Mathematics & Science domain for students in the Arts stream, and subject from the Humanities & Arts domain for students in the Science stream) that may be offered at either H1 or H2.  
   
**From AY2026 AU admissions,** the fourth H1/H2 content-based subject (which may be a contrasting subject) will only be included in the computation of UAS if it improves the score for students who sat for the GCE A-Level examinations in 2025 and after.
