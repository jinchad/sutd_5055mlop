### Park(ing) Day

![](/SUTD/media/SUTD/parking-day-header.jpg)Image credit: URA  
  
Inspired by the Park(ing) Day international movement, SUTD architecture professor and students in collaboration with local NGOs Participate-in-Design (P!D) and ReallyArchitecture (re:ACT), started Singapore’s very own Park(ing) Day back in 2013, as an experiment to rethink our urban spaces.   
  
Park(ing) Day is a 1-day event, including setting up and tear-down, where participants will be able to experience urban design, real-world prototyping, community engagement, creative expression, etc. while at the same time appreciate urban culture and other sustainability values, and be part of a national ground-up movement.  
  
It is easy to convert a parking lot into a new public space with simple props, all you need is creative ideas.

Each year, our students from the Fifth Row club – SUTDio, will conduct design workshops with the participating schools for the ideation of their Park(ing) Day installations. SUTD students will also share their experience and facilitate the understanding of the site, development of ideas, prototype making and etc., through the one-day workshop and site recce.

### SUTD X Artificial Intelligence and Design Innovation Series

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fast becoming a large part of our everyday lives. It is the key technology in many applications like facial recognition, image classifications and chatbots. As the technology progresses, AI will become one of the key enablers to achieve Singapore’s Smart Nation vision.  
   
At SUTD, we understand that AI, when combined with the power of Design Innovation (DI) – which comes from understanding human needs and innovating products, services and systems to improve the way we live, will accelerate the impact on business performances, drive sustainable growth and transform industries. Students will get to learn and experience this through our series of AI x DI programmes.

![](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/women3.jpg)  
SUTD takes pride in attracting a 40% female student cohort yearly.  
  
The SUTD – Women x Tech and Design (WxTD) Series is one of SUTD’s signature outreach efforts to inspire students, particularly, female students, to explore the endless potential to better the world with technology and design. Events from this series are hands-on and inspiring, which could range from a design workshop to an experience in our collaborating organisation.

##### **Introduction to Python Coding**

![](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dv-intro-python.jpg)  
Python is one of the most popular programming languages today, with many applications in computing, engineering, data science and artificial intelligence. This workshop provides an opportunity for pre-university students to find out why, and learn from experts from SUTD to put some basic concepts into application.

##### **Introduction To Singapore’s Architecture and Sketching**

![](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dv-intro-sketching.jpg)  
Learn about Singapore’s vibrant and beautiful early modern architectural masterpieces, and bring streamlined design to life through a guided sketching workshop by our faculty and students. Participants are introduced to Singapore’s rich art deco-styled architectural past with links to present conserved buildings, such as those found in Tiong Bahru, and get to try their hand at basic hand-sketching – a primary means that aspiring designers use to visually brainstorm basic design ideas and forms.

##### **Park(ing) Day**

![](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/parking-day-header.jpg)Image credit: URA  
  
Inspired by the Park(ing) Day international movement, SUTD architecture professor and students in collaboration with local NGOs Participate-in-Design (P!D) and ReallyArchitecture (re:ACT), started Singapore’s very own Park(ing) Day back in 2013, as an experiment to rethink our urban spaces.   
  
Park(ing) Day is a 1-day event, including setting up and tear-down, where participants will be able to experience urban design, real-world prototyping, community engagement, creative expression, etc. while at the same time appreciate urban culture and other sustainability values, and be part of a national ground-up movement.  
  
It is easy to convert a parking lot into a new public space with simple props, all you need is creative ideas.

Each year, our students from the Fifth Row club – SUTDio, will conduct design workshops with the participating schools for the ideation of their Park(ing) Day installations. SUTD students will also share their experience and facilitate the understanding of the site, development of ideas, prototype making and etc., through the one-day workshop and site recce.

##### **SUTD X Artificial Intelligence and Design Innovation Series**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fast becoming a large part of our everyday lives. It is the key technology in many applications like facial recognition, image classifications and chatbots. As the technology progresses, AI will become one of the key enablers to achieve Singapore’s Smart Nation vision.  
   
At SUTD, we understand that AI, when combined with the power of Design Innovation (DI) – which comes from understanding human needs and innovating products, services and systems to improve the way we live, will accelerate the impact on business performances, drive sustainable growth and transform industries. Students will get to learn and experience this through our series of AI x DI programmes.
