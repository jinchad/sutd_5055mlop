How_do_I_apply_for_your_special_programmes_(SUTD-D



How do I apply for your special programmes (SUTD-DUKE-NUS Special Track/SHARP) and what are the admission requirements?
=======================================================================================================================

You will need to indicate your intention to apply for either of these special programmes in the online application via SUTD Admissions Portal.  
  
Relevant admission requirements can be found at the following corresponding pages:



* [SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track](/education/undergraduate/special-programmes/sutd-duke-nus/overview/)
* [SHARP](/education/undergraduate/special-programmes/sharp/overview/)


You can apply for a maximum of two special programmes, and will be required to rank the programmes in order of your preference.   
  
Applicants who are shortlisted for SHARP will be informed of the programme you are shortlisted for, and the specific selection process prior to your interview. For SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track, applicants must have accepted SUTD’s admission offer first before you can be shortlisted for the conditional admission interview at Duke-NUS.
