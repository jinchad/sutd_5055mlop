What_can_I_use_the_Post-Secondary_Education_Accoun



What can I use the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) funds for? If I have applied for and been awarded Tuition Fee Loan (TFL) and/or Study Loan (SL), can I still use my PSEA funds?
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

You may use your own or your siblings’ PSEA funds to pay for tuition fees, compulsory miscellaneous fees and hostel fees (for Freshmore terms where the hostel stay is compulsory). PSEA funds can also be used for enrichment programmes such as overseas student programmes and local and overseas conferences/competitions approved and endorsed by the University. The withdrawal limit is up to the PSEA balance.  
  
For more information and application, please refer to the [PSEA page](/admissions/undergraduate/financing-options-and-aid/other-financing-options/post-secondary-education-account/).  
  
For enquiries, please write to: [psea@sutd.edu.sg](mailto:psea@sutd.edu.sg).



If you have been awarded the TFL and/or SL, the PSEA funds will be used first to offset your tuition fees and compulsory miscellaneous fees. The TFL and SL will then be applied to clear any outstanding tuition fees after deducting your PSEA funds.
