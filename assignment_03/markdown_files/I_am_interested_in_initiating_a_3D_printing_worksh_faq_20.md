I am interested in initiating a 3D printing workshop. Must I fulfil the minimum 26 contact hours within a term to be eligible for the UTOP certificate?

To be eligible for UTOP certification, your entire UTOP activity must fulfil a minimum of 26 contact hours (of which 1/3 of the total contact hours can be considered towards course preparatory/administrative work). However, it need not be within a term. It can be, for example, within a 3-day workshop too.
