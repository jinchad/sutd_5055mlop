I_am_undecided_between_EPD_and_ASD._How_should_I_d



I am undecided between EPD and ASD. How should I decide? Curious to hear from your perspective.
===============================================================================================

Broadly, EPD is about designing and developing products. ASD is about architectural design. One is an engineering-based degree, the other is an architectural-based degree. Considering the SUTD admission philosophy where one makes a pillar selection at the end of the first year (i.e., end of Term 3), one should also use the first year to better understand the differences between each pillar to make an educated choice. Pillar Information Sessions are also held regularly to address queries and clarify doubts.
