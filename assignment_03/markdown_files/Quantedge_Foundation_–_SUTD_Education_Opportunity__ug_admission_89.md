| Quantedge Foundation is a philanthropic foundation that aims to deliver impactful solutions to social issues and challenges in Singapore. Established by the principals of Quantedge Capital, the Foundation is registered as a Charity and has been an Institution of Public Character in Singapore since February 2016.   Quantedge Foundation believes that every youth should have an equal opportunity to succeed. We support programmes that equalise access to education and opportunities, and improve social mobility. Working with partner organisations such as SUTD, we design programmes that alleviate unfavourable starting conditions in life and expand the opportunity set for underprivileged youths, as a pathway to lifting them and their families out of inter-generational poverty.    The Foundation has also supported efforts to promote a more inclusive and caring society, by raising awareness of vulnerable communities in Singapore and seed-funding projects to meet their diverse needs.    <https://www.quantedge.org>    Media Links:   * **“University to offer grant, bursary to needy students”**, 24 Oct 2019, The Straits Times, <https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/university-to-offer-grant-bursary-to-needy-students> * **“新科大获机构与企业捐赠400万元 用来设立助学金与补助金”**, 24 Oct 2019, Lianhe Zaobao, <https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/singapore/story20191024-999521> * **“SUTD gets S$4m boost to help needy students”**, 23 Oct 2019, CNA, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cDKs7GlKPY> * **“SUTD to offer tuition grant and bursary award to students who need financial help”**, 23 Oct 2019, The Straits Times, <https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/sutd-to-offer-tuition-grant-and-bursary-award-to-students-who-need-financial> |
