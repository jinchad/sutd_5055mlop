Types of Funding
================

##### **Funding under Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy (“MCES”)**

1. MCES is an enhanced Subsidy to encourage mid-career individuals to upskill and reskill, thereby helping them to remain competitive and resilient in the job market. With this, all Singaporeans aged 40 and above will receive higher subsidies of up to 90% course fee subsidy for SSG-funded certifiable courses.
2. Individuals/employers are not required to submit an application for the MCES. Those pursuing SSG-funded programmes will be charged the appropriate subsidised fees by SUTD Academy if they are eligible MCES. Individuals/employers will only need to pay the nett fee (full course fee after SSG’s grant). For more info, please visit SkillsFuture website at <https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/enhancedsubsidy>

##### **Funding under Enhanced Training Support for SMEs (“ETSS”)**

1. ETSS is an enhanced funding to enable SMEs to send their employees for training.
2. SMEs will enjoy subsidies of up to 90% of the course fees when they sponsor their employees for SSG-funded certifiable courses.
3. In addition to higher course fee funding, SMEs can also claim absentee payroll funding of 80% of basic hourly salary at a higher cap of $7.50 per hour. SMEs may apply for the absentee payroll via the SkillsConnect system.
4. To qualify, SMEs must meet all of the following criteria:  
   – Organisation must be registered or incorporated in Singapore  
   – Employment size of not more than 200 or with annual sales turnover of not more than $100 million  
   – Trainees must be hired in accordance with the Employment Act and fully sponsored by their employers for the course

##### **Funding under Union Training Assistance Programme (“UTAP”)**

UTAP is a training benefit for NTUC members to defray their cost of training. This benefit is to encourage more union members to go for skills upgrading.

NTUC members enjoy 50% unfunded course fee support for up to $250 each year when you sign up for courses supported under UTAP (Union Training Assistance Programme).

For more info, please visit <https://e2i.com.sg/individuals/ntuc-education-and-training-fund/>.

##### **Funding under Post-Secondary Education Account (“PSEA”)**

The Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) is part of the Post-Secondary Education Scheme to help pay for the post-secondary education of Singaporeans.

This is part of the Government’s efforts to encourage every Singaporean to complete their post-secondary education. It also underscores the Government’s commitment to support families in investing in the future education of their children and to prepare them for the economy of the future. PSEA is not a bank account.

It is administered by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and is opened automatically for all eligible Singaporeans.

Account holders can use their PSEA funds to pay for their own or their siblings’ approved fees and charges for approved programs conducted by approved institutions.

However, you will have to check your eligibility and balance by contacting MOE first.
