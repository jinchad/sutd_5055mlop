Do I have to pay interest for Tuition Fee Loan (TFL)/ Study Loan (SL) during my course of study and when does repayment of the loan commence?
=============================================================================================================================================

TFL and SL are interest-free during the course of study i.e. interest will only be computed upon graduation and is based on the [average prime rate](https://www.abs.org.sg/benchmark-rates/prime-lending-rates) of the 3 local banks (DBS, OCBC, and UOB).




**TFL:** Repayment should be made not later than 2 years after graduation or on securing employment, whichever is earlier.



**SL:** Repayment commences within 6 months after graduation or upon graduates securing employment, whichever is earlier.



For further queries, please contact DBS directly.
