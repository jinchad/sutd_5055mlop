### Post-Secondary Education Account

The PSEA scheme started in the year 2007 with the intention to encourage parents to save for their children’s post-secondary education by maintaining a Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) for each eligible child.

This is part of the Government’s efforts to encourage every Singapore Citizen to complete his/her post-secondary education. It also underscores the Government’s commitment to support families in investing in the future education of their children, and to prepare them for the economy of the future. PSEA is not a bank account.

##### **Eligibility**

The PSEA is administered by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and is opened to all eligible Singapore Citizens. Students may use their own or their siblings’ PSEA funds to pay for course fees.

###### STANDING ORDER – Using PSEA Funds for payment on a recurring basis

For student using his/her own PSEA, click [here for the **Online Standing Order application**](https://go.gov.sg/psea-standing-order) via student’s SingPass.  
(For student below 21 years old at the point of submission, please inform your parent to submit the online application on your behalf via his/her SingPass.)

For student using his/her sibling’s PSEA, click [here for the **Online Standing Order (Sibling) application**](https://go.gov.sg/psea-standing-order).

This is a one-time application. Upon approval of the Standing Order by MOE, funds will be automatically withdrawn from the PSEA for payment of *Tuition Fees and Compulsory Miscellaneous Fees*, until the funds are used up or when the Standing Order is terminated or replaced.

**Termination of Standing Order**  
To terminate the Standing Order, please submit the [online **Termination of Standing Order Form**](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e8581e37191390011a12e22).Applicants are required to sign in with their SingPass account in order to complete the online form. Please note that submission of the FormSG to terminate PSEA SO will be sent directly to MOE PSEA Unit for processing.

1. Students are advised to call the Edusave/ PSEA Scheme hotline to check if there are sufficient funds in their account to cover the withdrawal amount before submitting the Standing Order or Ad Hoc Withdrawal form.
2. The parent or legal guardian must authorise the application if the student and/or sibling is/are below 21 years old.
3. MOE will inform students of the application outcome. A monthly Transaction Statement will be sent to the account holder if there are PSEA contributions, withdrawal or refund transactions in the previous month. Students can check with MOE, 2 weeks after the submission of the application form on the amount of funds withdrawn from their PSEA account.
