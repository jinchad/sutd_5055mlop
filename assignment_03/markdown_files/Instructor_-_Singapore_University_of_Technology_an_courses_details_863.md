#### **Joel Yang**

**Associate Professor,**Engineering Product Development (EPD), Singapore University of Technology and Design

Joel received his PhD (2009) and Master of Science (2005) degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He is an Associate Professor in the Engineering Product Development pillar at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and holds a joint appointment as Principal Scientist I at the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE) of A\*STAR. He is recognized for pioneering work in plasmonic colour printing, achieving record-level printing resolution at 100,000 dpi and credited for the widely-used “salty-developer” to improve the resolution of electron beam lithography.

Joel’s research interests include Nanoplasmonics, 2D and 3D printed nano optical design elements (NODE), and sub-10-nm resolution lithography. He serves as Associate Editor of Science Advances, Associate Editor of Optics Express, and member of the Editorial Advisory Board of ACS Photonics. He is Fellow of OSA The Optical Society, NRF Investigator (class of 2020), and A\*STAR Investigator (2010).
