### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science](/course/ModularMaster-in-Data-Science "ModularMasters in Data Science") programme**

#### Your first step to Python

Computational thinking is a necessary skill for 21st century work force. One way to sharpen this computational thinking is by learning how to program.

The course will provide an overview of computational thinking and programming using Python 3. Participants will learn through hands-on practice, how to solve problems using PCDIT framework, write idiomatic Python codes, and test their implementation.

This course will also focus on the applications of Python to real-world applications in Data Science.
