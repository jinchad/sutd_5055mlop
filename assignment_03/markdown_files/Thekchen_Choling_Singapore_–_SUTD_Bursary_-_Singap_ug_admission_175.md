| **THIS AWARD IS MADE POSSIBLE BY:** |
| **Thekchen Choling**   Named after the monastery of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Thekchen Choling means ‘Great Mahayana Dharma Temple’.    Our Spiritual Director, Singha Rinpoche, founded the temple in hopes that through the Dharma, both our lay and ordained followers can realise their inner potential for a life of greater fulfilment and happiness. |
