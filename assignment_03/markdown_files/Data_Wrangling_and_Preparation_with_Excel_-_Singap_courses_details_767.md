### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science](/course/ModularMaster-in-Data-Science "ModularMasters in Data Science") (Non-Programming Track) programme**

In computer science particularly, you may have heard of the phrase “Garbage in, garbage out”; and that’s true for data analysis, the importance of having quality and the right data format is critical to any data science project. Data wrangling is the function of transforming raw data into data that is usable down the data science process.

This course is designed to introduce the general concepts of Data Science with a focus on Data Wrangling for participants with non-programming backgrounds. By the end of this course, participants will be able to wrangle data and prepare the dataset ready for Machine Learning Model.

##### **Plan your learning path**

This course can be taken as a module on its own or as part of the **[Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics (Non-Programming)](/course/Graduate-Certificate-Data-Science "Learn more")** stack and participants will earn 12 subject credits which can also be used towards completing the **[ModularMaster in Data Science](/course/ModularMaster-in-Data-Science "Learn more")**.

##### **Course Details**

**Course Dates:**
