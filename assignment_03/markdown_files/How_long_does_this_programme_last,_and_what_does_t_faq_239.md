How_long_does_this_programme_last,_and_what_does_t



How long does this programme last, and what does the commitment look like?
==========================================================================

Typically between 12 to 14 weeks. Apart from attending the workshops, you may be expected to complete assignments outside of class (e.g., interviewing customers, preparing pitches and actively consulting your mentor).




As our programmes are designed to take you from zero-to-one in the most efficient way, we encourage you to follow through the full course of the programme. We understand if you have one-off commitments which might affect your attendance, but do make time if you are signing up.




We also have a short introductory programme and one-off events for you to take that first step!
