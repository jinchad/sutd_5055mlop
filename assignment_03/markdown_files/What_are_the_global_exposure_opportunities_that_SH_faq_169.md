What are the global exposure opportunities that SHARP students can be excited about?
====================================================================================

SHARP students who are awarded the [SUTD Global Excellence Scholarship](/admissions/undergraduate/scholarship/sutd-administered/sutd-global-excellence-scholarship/), [SUTD Global Distinguished Scholarship](/admissions/undergraduate/scholarship/sutd-administered/sutd-global-distinguished-scholarship/) or the [SUTD Global Merit Scholarship](/admissions/undergraduate/scholarship/sutd-administered/sutd-global-merit-scholarship/) will enjoy sponsorship and priority consideration for our overseas immersion programmes\*\*, which include [Summer Programmes](/campus-life/global-experience-and-exchange/summer-programmes/) and the [Global Exchange Programme (GEXP)](/campus-life/global-experience-and-exchange/student-exchange/) at one of SUTD’s partner institutions overseas – in Americas, Europe, Asia and Oceania. \*\* Certain overseas programmes may be withdrawn, cut down or subject to change due to the occurrence of events beyond the control of SUTD. Students can also look forward to opportunities to attend overseas conferences to present their research papers.
