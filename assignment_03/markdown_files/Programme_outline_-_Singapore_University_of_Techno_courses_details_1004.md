### Programme Outline

##### **Learning Objectives and Structure**

1. Perform the statistical validation component for the role of a junior data scientist, Statistician and/or Researcher.
2. Validate dataset statistically to support data analysis and modelling
3. Explore on data distribution and identify statistical anomalies
4. Compute Statistical Indicators for the dataset
5. Check normality assumption for a data series
6. Perform statistical test and validation on dataset
7. Conduct further statistical analysis

**Programme Structure**: Participants will go through 4 days of training. Class will reconvene on the 5th day for a presentation as part of the course assessment.
