How do I appeal against the admissions decision?
================================================

Please refer to the timeline and process outlined in the appeal section of the [application process here](/admissions/undergraduate/appeal/).



Your appeal must represent significant and compelling new academic and/or personal information that was not present at the time of application and which brings merit for reconsideration.




Only applicants who have submitted an application in the current admissions exercise, and have received outcomes of your application may submit an appeal. Appeals can only be submitted [here](https://admission.sutd.edu.sg/psc/CSADM1PRD/APPLICANT/HRMS/c/N_ADMISSIONS.N_AD_APPLUG_APL.GBL/action=U) after logging into the [SUTD Admissions System](https://admission.sutd.edu.sg/psc/CSADM1PRD/APPLICANT/HRMS/c/N_ADMISSIONS.N_AD_APPLUG_APL.GBL/action=U?&). Appeals via any other channels will not be considered.
