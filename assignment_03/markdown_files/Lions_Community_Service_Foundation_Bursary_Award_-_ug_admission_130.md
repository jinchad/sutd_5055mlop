| **LIONS COMMUNITY SERVICE FOUNDATION (SINGAPORE)**   **VISION** To be the leading source of philanthropic giving for the conduct of charitable services in Singapore from funds raised by Lions Clubs.    **MISSION** To be the central organisation for fiscal resources generated by Lions fund-raising activities and to extend the scope of tax-exempt donations to Lions causes in Singapore beyond services to the lonely, sick and poor elderly.    **OVERVIEW** The Lions Community Service Foundation (Singapore) (LCSF) was registered as a Charity in Singapore in 2003 to succeed the then District Foundation. It is also an approved Institution of a Public Character (IPC) entitling it to receive tax exempt donations.    **ACTIVITIES:**    **1) Financial Hardship Assistance**    **Students:** The LCSF administered Lions Education Fund, established by the District in 2008 for the purpose of establishing scholarships, bursaries and other schemes to provide financial assistance to needy and deserving students from primary up to tertiary level.    **Families:** LCSF also provides financial assistance to families due to the sudden death or illness of the main breadwinner or other economic hardship but whose family income does not meet the eligibility criteria for government financial assistance. Similar criteria also apply to grants to assist the procurement of prosthetic limbs through the Lions Prosthesis Centre (Singapore).    **2) Local Application of Lions Clubs International Global Causes – Vision & Diabetes Awareness**  **Vision:** Lions Clubs organise regular sight screening projects together with grassroots organisations for residents in various constituencies as part of their general health awareness programs.    **Fight against Diabetes:** Diabetes is prevalent in Singapore as a modern lifestyle illness. As there are organisations in Singapore providing dialysis facilities to diabetic patients, the Lions contribution is focused on the consequences of diabetes such as vision loss and amputation of limbs, usually the legs. The cost of prosthetic limbs to improve amputee mobility can be prohibitive to the low income earner. Lions Clubs in Singapore established the Lions Prosthesis Centre (Singapore) in 2019 to provide free or subsidised prosthesis to deserving patients.
