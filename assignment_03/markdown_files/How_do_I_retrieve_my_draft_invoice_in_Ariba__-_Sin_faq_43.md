How do I retrieve my draft invoice in Ariba?
============================================

Please refer to the [user guide on “How to Retrieve a Draft Invoice”](/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/How-to-Retrieve-a-Draft-Invoice.pdf).

Do note that a draft invoice has a retention period of 50 days. If you edit it again, the draft is saved for 50 days from its latest change date. You can edit a draft invoice more than once. If the invoice is not submitted or edited within 50 days from the last change date, the draft invoice is automatically deleted.
