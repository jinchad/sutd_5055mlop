Structured Internship
=====================

The 16-week SUTD Internship programme is an initiative that will aid students in making connections between their study of architecture and the real world of practice by undertaking supervised work placements in architectural firms which we shall call the “employer”. Assigned work may encompass a wide range of tasks that is discussed and decided by the employer, the intern and SUTD. The structured internship serves as a preamble for the students’ master’s thesis. During the structured internship, students will develop ideas for their master’s thesis in selected thematic areas related to sustainable design. The structured internship encourages students to take inspirations for their thesis subjects from working in the industry and interacting with their employers. As such, the structured internship should be relevant to the future studies and perhaps career of the intern. Employers should ensure scope of internship is meaningful and that the internship is carried out fully on the employer’s premises (i.e. not based in SUTD). During the structured internship, students will meet once a month with their SUTD advisors in order to discuss their evolving thesis subjects.
