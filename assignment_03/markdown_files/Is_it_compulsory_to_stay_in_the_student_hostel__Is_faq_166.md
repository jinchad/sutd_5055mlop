Is it compulsory to stay in the student hostel? Is there a curfew?
==================================================================

Yes, Freshmores are required to reside at the hostel during Terms 1 and 2 including those who live near the campus, as residential living is an integrated part of the SUTD Freshmore experience, complementing the cohort-based learning in and out of classrooms.



While there is no curfew and students are free to return home or go out to attend to personal matters, students are expected to observe stipulated quiet hours to minimise disturbance to fellow residents.
