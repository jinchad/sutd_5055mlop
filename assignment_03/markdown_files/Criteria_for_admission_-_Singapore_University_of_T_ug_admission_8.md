### Criteria for Admission

Regardless of your nationality, if you are applying with an International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), St. Joseph’s Institution, School of the Arts (SOTA), and Singapore Sports School, you may refer to the admission requirements below and apply using [this application form](https://admission.sutd.edu.sg/psp/CSADM1PRD/APPLICANT/HRMS/?cmd=login&languageCd=ENG&). If you are not from any of these schools, please apply through [International Baccalaureate Diploma (International)](/admissions/undergraduate/international-baccalaureate-diploma-international/criteria-for-admission/) listed under International Qualifications.

Applicants will have to authorise the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) to release your International Baccalaureate (IB) transcripts to SUTD. Please approach your school Diploma Programme coordinator for more details.

##### **Subject Requirements**

* You should possess good passes in at least three Higher Level and one Standard Level subjects as well as Theory of Knowledge (TOK).
* While it is recommended that you have taken Mathematics and a Science subject, i.e Physics or Chemistry, at Higher Level, we do consider your results in Mathematics and the Science subjects taken at Standard Level, as well as in IBDP Year 4, O-level or equivalent. You may also be encouraged to take bridging modules before start of term.

##### **Mother Tongue Language (MTL)**

All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are required to fulfil the MTL requirement for admission into full-time publicly-funded undergraduate programmes in the universities.

The MTL requirement may be fulfilled through the following:

1. a D7 grade for Higher MTL at Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level (the iGCSE MTL First Language examination does not fulfil the requirement); or
2. a pass in MTL ‘B’ or a S grade for H1 MTL/ MTL-in-lieu or H2 MTL Language and Literature or H1 General Studies in Chinese at Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level; or
3. a pass in MTL A: Literature, or MTL A: Language and Literature, or Language B MTL at Standard or Higher Level at International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (the IB Standard Level Language ab initio does not fulfil the requirement).

Those who have not fulfilled the MTL requirement may still apply for admission with no prejudice to their application. However, if accepted, they will be required to fulfil the MTL requirement during their course of study.

Applicants who have been away from Singapore’s school system for some years and have not kept up with the study of their MTL or a language that can be offered as MTL-in-lieu may apply for MTL exemption. The MTL exemption application will be facilitated by the universities as part of the university application, and the results made known to applicants who receive admission offers from the university. Please note that MOE does not accept direct applications for MTL exemption. The application for MTL exemption will also not prejudice the evaluation of the application for a place in the university.

Please note that SAT and AP scores are optional. Do visit the [US College Board website](https://www.collegeboard.org/) for details and registration. You should indicate 6532 (SUTD Institution Code) on your SAT registration forms, so that the scores will be sent directly to us by the US College Board.

##### **Online Application Form**

For each University Admissions Exercise, we only accept one application from you made through our online application form. Duplicate applications will not be processed.

You may refer to the [overview of the online application process](/admissions/undergraduate/application-guide/) for more information.
