#### 

Instructor, SUTD Academy  
Consultant, PolicyPal

Ben’s fascination with product management and data analytics began when he was working at iwoca, a London based Fintech startup. In his work there, he combined financial data with non-traditional data sources to build credit models used to provide loans to over 10,000 SMEs.

Upon returning home to Singapore, he spent 4 years at a local Fintech startup, Funding Societies. He helped to grow the business from Series A to Series C, taking on technical (Head of Data Analytics) and product (Head of Digital Lending) roles along the way.

Today, Ben consults with startups and SMEs to help them thrive in the digital world. He provides management consulting services, builds and coaches teams to deliver digital products and to solve problems in innovative ways.

Ben has also spent time at Barclays and Amazon and has experience in leading teams to deliver products and analytics for senior management. He holds a BSc Economics from University College London (UCL).
