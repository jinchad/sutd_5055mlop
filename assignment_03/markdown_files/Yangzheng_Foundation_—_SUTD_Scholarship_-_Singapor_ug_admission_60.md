| Yangzheng was the name of a Chinese-stream Primary School supported by the Cantonese Community and it had educated generations of students from 1906 to the late 1980s. When the private school closed, its patrons set up the Yangzheng Foundation (飬正基金) to promote, foster, develop and improve education in Singapore and to provide financial support for needy students and other charitable bodies to aid social development for society. A strong supporter of educational causes, the Foundation has benefitted many schools, including Yangzheng Primary School, the present day government school that bears the Yangzheng’s Chinese name (飬正). The Foundation has also been actively involved in helping the community, through support for children and the elderly, as well as restoration projects and other causes.
