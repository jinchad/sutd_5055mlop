Sustainable engineering is the integration of social, environmental, and economic considerations in the design of products, processes, and engineered systems. This full-day interactive course introduces the concept of sustainability – both theory and applications – to engineers and designers. Participants will learn of tools available to perform life-cycle assessment (LCA), guided by real-life case studies. Takeaways include a perspective on resource circularity, sustainable design, maintenance, and operations of products and systems.
