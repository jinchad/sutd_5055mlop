### Overview

Like any other instructional solution, a game should be carefully designed, developed, and implemented to facilitate learning. The goal of a serious game is not only to create an immersive and engaging experience for learners, but also for them to achieve a specific learning outcome. Game designers have a strong understanding of game goals, core dynamics, game mechanics and game elements. But this does not guarantee a serious game if designers do not possess solid instructional design skills.

Day 1 starts with an introduction of what serious games are, followed by a quick look into the interplay between cellular and molecular storage mechanisms and the cognitive neuroscience of memory and learning. This is followed by a peek at why people play and the motivational theories that interpret this behaviour. Students are then briefed on serious game design fundamentals, with a focus on iterative design approach and playtest. Day 2 will commence with project management (timeline, budget, and marketing) of serious games, followed by shared experiences of real world case studies. Finally, the need for a unique assessment and accreditation framework for serious games will be covered.
