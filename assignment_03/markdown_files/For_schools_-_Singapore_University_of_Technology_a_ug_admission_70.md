###### **Workshops**

SUTD regularly organises workshops designed to give pre-university students a hands-on experience at technology and design.

The workshops may be conducted by our faculty members and/or student facilitators, and the themes, content and duration of the workshops may be tailored for different target audiences. Some examples include a Micro-Design Innovation experience, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Python Coding, Introduction to Architectural Design Techniques and more.

We have our Fabrication Laboratory on wheels (FabLab Mobile) which can be equipped with various fabrication machineries and can be pulled on-site to support workshops or activities.

Past deployments include bringing equipment such as 3D printers and laser cutters on-site for demonstrations and sharing of student projects.
