Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

###### Will all applicants be interviewed?

Only shortlisted applicants will be interviewed by SUTD for the admission into the Bachelor programme and Duke-NUS for the conditional admission into the MD programme.

---

###### Is either SAT or IELTS score submission compulsory for admission? Is there any minimum requirement?

Submission of either IELTS, TOEFL, SAT, Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), ACT scores or C1 Advanced is compulsory for applicants who are presenting qualifications where English is not the medium of instruction.

There is no prescribed minimum score as your application will be reviewed comprehensively based on both academic and non-academic achievements.

###### Do I need to authorise the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) to release my IB transcript to SUTD?

Yes, you will have to authorise the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) to release your International Baccalaureate (IB) transcripts to SUTD. Please approach your school’s IB Diploma Programme coordinator for more details.

---

###### What is the minimum IB score for admissions? What subjects should I take in IB?

We do not have a minimum IB score requirement as we practise a comprehensive review of applications where we consider all **academic** and **personal attributes** to assess if you are able to cope with the rigour of our programme and will fit in well in SUTD.

For the former, it is recommended that you have taken Higher Level Mathematics (either MAA or MAI) and at least one Higher Level Science subject, eg. Physics or Chemistry, though students with other subject combinations will also be considered. We will also take into consideration your grades at IBDP Year 4, O-level or equivalent.

For the latter, through your participation in co-curricular activities, accomplishments, teacher’s recommendations, and responses to our personal insight questions, we hope to gain a better understanding of you as an individual, and if you have the attributes to flourish in SUTD.
