This course seeks to equip sustainability professionals with the foundational knowledge required to build a sustainability strategy. By first looking into the history and drivers of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), participants will develop a deeper understanding of various sustainability models such as corporate citizenship and Triple Bottom Line accounting, to eventually apply them to their own organisation. Participants will learn key strategies in implementing stewardship, engagement, and governance, as well as how to avoid pitfalls like greenwashing.
