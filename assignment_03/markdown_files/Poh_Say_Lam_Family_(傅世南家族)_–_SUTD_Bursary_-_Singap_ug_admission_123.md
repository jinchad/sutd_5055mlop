| **THIS BURSARY AWARD IS ESTABLISHED IN HONOUR OF THE LATE MR POH SAY LAM**   Mr Poh was a magnanimous, generous and kind father who instilled in his children the significance of pursuing a good education in order to become productive members of society. Leading by example, he encouraged the family to be benevolent and share as a family as well as a community. To commemorate his legacy and in gratitude to Mr Poh’s insistence on education, the Poh Family has established this bursary in his name to honour the values that he held dear and provide the gift of education to students in need. |
