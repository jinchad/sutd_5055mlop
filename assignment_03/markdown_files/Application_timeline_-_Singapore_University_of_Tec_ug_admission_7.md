###### What is the minimum IB score for admissions? What subjects should I take in IB?

We do not have a minimum IB score requirement as we practise a comprehensive review of applications where we consider all **academic** and **personal attributes** to assess if you are able to cope with the rigour of our programme and will fit in well in SUTD.

For the former, it is recommended that you have taken Higher Level Mathematics (either MAA or MAI) and at least one Higher Level Science subject, eg. Physics or Chemistry, though students with other subject combinations will also be considered. We will also take into consideration your grades at IBDP Year 4, O-level or equivalent.

For the latter, through your participation in co-curricular activities, accomplishments, teacher’s recommendations, and responses to our personal insight questions, we hope to gain a better understanding of you as an individual, and if you have the attributes to flourish in SUTD.
