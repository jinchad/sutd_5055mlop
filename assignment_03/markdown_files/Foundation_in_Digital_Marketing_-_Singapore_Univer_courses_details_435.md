Overview

##### How to create the complete digital marketing plan for your business

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Strategic Digital Marketing](/repo/course/modularmaster-in-strategic-digital-marketing/ "ModularMasters in Strategic Digital Marketing") programme**

Many learn marketing while on the job, while few have any proper education in marketing. Without proper marketing schooling, aspiring marketers may miss golden opportunities when crafting plans to target key segments or perhaps miss out on selecting effective channels or platforms to deliver key marketing messages. Some marketers may feel they lack the knowledge to deal with their advertising/marketing agencies or with seniors in their organisation. Armed with sound practitioner-based marketing knowledge, marketers can redress this marketing-power imbalance while driving effective marketing campaigns.

*“[Nick] made sure we fully understood the concepts by frequently punctuating the course with hands-on activities. He also provided current examples that were relevant and relatable to the different professionals in the class. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and wished we had more time to learn from him.”*
