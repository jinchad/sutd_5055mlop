What are the requirements for a supervisor of an SUTD intern?
=============================================================

You will be required to provide your approval for two internship reports, via the internship portal. The reports will be submitted on the 1st day of the 6th week of the internship, as well as 2 weeks before the end of the internship. The interns will also be required to produce a poster two weeks before the end of the internship, and you will be required to vet it for confidential content prior to their submission. Unlike the reports, the vetting and approval is verbally issued to the interns instead of through the portal.
