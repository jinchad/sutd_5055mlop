What should I submit for my personal portfolio? What does SUTD look out for?
============================================================================

Your personal portfolio should demonstrate your relevant attributes and showcase accomplishments in your interest areas, such as (though not exhaustive): completing external courses in your area of interest (e.g. programming), participating and winning external competitions (e.g. hackathons, IT bug bounty hunt, etc.), personal achievements (coding your own app to solve a problem, starting your own business venture, etc.) or even how you succeeded against all odds in the face of adversity. Through these, we hope to gain a better understanding of you as an individual, and assess if you have the traits to flourish in SUTD.
