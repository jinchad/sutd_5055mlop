| **THIS SCHOLARSHIP IS MADE POSSIBLE BY:**Mr Tan Tuck Meng (1916 – 1997) was a Singapore businessman who started a wholesale business in rice, sugar and essentials. A key value he taught his family is never to succumb to temptations and greed. He believed that a succeeding generation must be better educated than the incumbent. This scholarship is established in his memory. |
