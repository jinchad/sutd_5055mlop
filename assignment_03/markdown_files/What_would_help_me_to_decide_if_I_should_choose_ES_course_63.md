What would help me to decide if I should choose ESD?
====================================================

If you are someone who likes to explore data, analyse problems, connect the dots, and drives better strategic and operational decisions, you would want to choose ESD.

In addition, if you loves Maths and want to experience the thrill of applying mathematics to practival problems, use abstraction and generalization to make sense of engineering systems, and work with real clients on real problems, ESD will be the right programme for you too!
