### Overview

##### **Part of the [ModularMaster in Data Science](/course/ModularMaster-in-Data-Science "ModularMasters in Data Science") (Programming Track) programme**

Effective data science project relies on one critical aspect, data quality. With the right data quality, statistical analysis can then take place which translates data into meaningful insights for businesses. Data Validation plays an important role in ensuring the data is correct and useful in preparation for analysis.

This course is designed to introduce the general concepts of Data Science with a focus on Data Validation and Statistical Analysis for participants who prefer a programming approach. By the end of this course, participants will be able to leverage on Python for Data Validation and Statistical Analysis.

##### **Plan your learning path**

This course can be taken as a module on its own or as part of the **[Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics (Programming)](/course/Graduate-Certificate-Data-Science "Learn more")** stack and participants will earn 12 subject credits which can also be used towards completing the **[ModularMaster in Data Science](/course/ModularMaster-in-Data-Science "Learn more")**.

##### **Course Details**

**Course Dates:**  
13, 20, 27 May, 3, 10, 24 June 2025

**Closing date:**4 April 2025

**Duration**  
6 days, 9.00AM – 5.00PM

##### **Who Should Attend**

* Participants in roles which require hands-on validation and statistical analysis of data and modelling with programming.
* Aspiring data/business analysts or data scientists looking to acquire skills in the data validation and statistical analysis components.
* Ideal for participants who are in or looking to acquire skills for roles such as entry-level Data Analysts/Business Analysts.

**Prerequisites**

* Participants should preferably have passed mathematics at least ‘O’ Level or equivalent.
* Participants should preferably have basic knowledge of statistic.
* Participants should be conversant with basic IT skills such as software installation, file management and web navigation.
* Participants are encouraged to complete the Foundation of Data Science and Data Wrangling and Preparation with Programming before enrolling in this course.
* Participants are required to pass a pre-course assessment to ensure participants have the requisite knowledge of Python programming. This assessment can be waived if participants have completed both Fundamentals in Python (Basic) and Fundamentals in Python (Intermediate).
* Participants are required to bring their laptops.
