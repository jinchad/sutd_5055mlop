Students will also be asked to present their individual research plans during the course. This is the opportunity for the students to know what kind of researches their peers are doing and also for them to get suggestions and inspirations from others.3 CreditsInstructorsShengyuan YangComponentsParticipation and research reports (NO Final Exam) Image Credit
