Harnessing the confluence of design innovations and technology to medicine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s world, the use of technology and the design of the built environment play an increasingly significant role in improving the way we live and our quality of life. One area where this convergence of technology and design is making a huge impact is the practice of medicine.

The SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track aims to nurture future clinicians who are adept at both practising medicine and harnessing technological advancements across disciplines to impact healthcare. With the ability to treat patients and design medical innovations, these future clinicians will have an edge in the industry, quickly becoming the new benchmark. Our partnership with **[Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/)**, the **only US-styled graduate-entry medical school in Singapore**, will help deliver this unique programme which aims to nurture future leaders in healthcare. You will be prepared with a background in engineering or architecture, and can look forward to a technology and design focused curriculum which pushes you to think creatively and to work across disciplines.

> *“The SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track presents me with a unique opportunity to see beyond the primary responsibility of a doctor. The insights to healthcare systems and medical innovation have not only equipped me with a better understanding of future healthcare challenges, but further appreciate the tremendous and exciting potential our healthcare ecosystem holds.”*

##### **Message from programme directors**

*“Thank you for your interest in the SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track programme. We have designed this unique curricular pathway to nurture future clinician-innovators capable of harnessing technology and design to champion medical innovation for the betterment of healthcare. Students in this programme will spend 8 terms working on their Bachelors (Engineering or Science) at SUTD, followed by 4 years pursuing a Doctor in Medicine (MD) at Duke-NUS.*

*While at SUTD, you will expand your disciplinary knowledge and technical skills through the Core Curriculum under one of our five degree programmes (ASD, DAI, EPD, ESD, ISTD) while developing a broad multi-disciplinary understanding of the humanities, arts, and social sciences. Additionally, through healthcare workshops, a summer internship in a healthcare environment, healthcare research opportunities, and a healthcare-related final-year Capstone project, Special Track students will be well-prepared to design medical technology, systems, and infrastructure to address real-world healthcare needs.*

*What further differentiates the SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track is that you will have access to an integrated team of SUTD faculty and CGH clinicians, who will serve as teachers, advisors, and mentors during your educational journey from undergraduate to medical school. You can also expect to stay engaged with Duke-NUS through periodic meetings with Duke-NUS faculty and activities designed to provide insights into the medical school experience and a career in medicine.*

*We invite you to browse through this website for more information on the SUTD (Bachelor)-Duke-NUS (MD) Special Track programme. Please feel free to reach out anytime with questions or simply to learn more about what makes our programme tick.*

*We look forward to welcoming you on board our programme!*

*“Welcome to the SUTD-Duke-NUS Special Track programme website. This website will provide more information about this unique programme that aims to produce well-rounded, versatile students with a strong foundation in design thinking, technological innovations, and an entrepreneurial spirit through their undergraduate education at SUTD. Subsequently, these students will carry those knowledge, skills and attitudes into medical school to obtain their MD at Duke-NUS, and qualify as doctors.*

*With a team of clinician mentors working closely with faculty from SUTD, there are ample opportunities to have immersive experience and experiential learning with regard to the myriad of dimensions and disciplines within the healthcare ecosystem. The students will have first-hand experience of the healthcare system through attachments or internships in different healthcare institutions and health technology providers and partners. They also have opportunities to participate in healthcare and health technology research and development in these authentic settings. Ultimately, the programme hopes to nurture clinician innovators who will be able to have different perspectives to current and emerging healthcare problems, and derive useful and innovative solutions to them using their experience and background in design and technology.*

*I hope that you will find the information on this website helpful in your application process. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any other questions about the SUTD (Bachelor)-Duke-NUS (MD) Special Track programme.*

*I look forward to welcoming you as a student in this programme.*
