When_I_create_the_invoice_for_my_Purchase_Order_(P



When I create the invoice for my Purchase Order (PO) by clicking the “Create Invoice” button, the amount is zero and there are no line items. Why is that so?
=============================================================================================================================================================

Please ensure that a trading relationship is already established with SUTD.

When there are no line items to be invoiced and the amount is zero, it means that Goods Receipt (GR) has not been performed in the system by SUTD. Upon satisfactory goods and services being delivered to SUTD and being accepted by the buyer, they will perform GR in the system. Please approach the SUTD buyer/contact person if goods/services have been delivered but the line item and amount is still zero for invoicing.
