Perhaps it might help to maybe explain concepts to yourself or work out problems in the mirror, which would help you get used to verbalising your thought process. Maybe something like the ways you could approach the problem, and then how you’d select an approach from there. There might not be a right answer, or at least not one that you can feasibly come up with in an interview, so I would suggest being comfortable with thinking aloud.\n\nOr I could be completely off and it could be some kind of Physics question to solve because they want to know your aptitude in academics, idk",

I'm a 2020 Freshmore here so I'm in an honoured position to advise you on the new curriculum, that was brought forward from the planned 2022 implementation to 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n**Term 1 (all modules enjoy Pass/Fail status meaning they aren't factored into GPA)**\n\n* **Single Variable Calculus Math (Modelling and Analysis)**\n* **Mechanical and Thermodynamic Physics (Physical World)**\n* **Rhinoceros Software Archi Design + Python Coding Computing (Computational Thinking for Design)**\n* **Humanities (either the economics-based Theorising Self, Society and Culture, or the literature-based World Texts and Interpretations – the economics one is arguably easier than the literature one, so pray you get the literature one in Term 1)**\n\n***Personal Evaluation: The easiest mod by far would be the computing mod, as it's designed to pass everyone regardless (based on my batch's experience). Next would be Humanities (if you get the literature one) as it's comprised only of 3 important assignments and there's plenty of time to complete (we're talking 3 to 4 weeks of lead time). Physics is easier than Math in terms of visualising and conceptualising I'd say, but that's just my viewpoint. Your perspective may differ from mine depending on your academic strength.***\n\nIn Terms 2 and 3 collectively, students may choose 2 of 8 modules to be set to Pass/Fail status. In Term 3, students will be able to choose 2 modules from a selection of 4 electives, as part of a pilot programme to give students greater flexibility and freedom of choice to pursue their diverse interests.\n\n**Term 2**\n\n* **Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra** **(Modelling Space and Systems)**\n* **Electricity, Electromagnetism, Quantum Physics (Technological World)**\n* **Chemistry and Biology (Science for a Sustainable World)**\n* **Term-long Design (Introduction to Design)**\n\n**Term 3**\n\n* **Humanities (if you got the literature one in Term 1, you'll get the economics one here; vice versa)**\n* **Probability and Statistics Math (Modelling Uncertainty)**\n* 2 Electives (choose from 4 electives)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I cannot advise on Terms 2 and 3 as I've yet to experience for myself the stress and challenges that will come my path going into AY2021. That's all I can share at the moment. Hope this helps somewhat!",

SUTD Housing definitely has a way of doing a good (but not too great) pairing. Of course there's a chance you do not get the luck of the draw, as with some of my classmates who gripe about their roommate.\n2. Very common, unless you choose not to go home. The workload is manageable enough to accommodate fam time on weekends, just have to be super diligent and efficient in your work ethic to avoid slipping behind or en route to failing your important tests, quizzes and assignments.\n3. Depends on your classmates and level mates. Some, myself included, can't be bothered to cook, and just rely on canteen food, or SUTD's restaurants, or head out to Changi City Point / Tampines Mall / Tampines1 for some good food (if time permits). But I know of many who have the time to cook at the communal kitchen (found in all 3 hostel blocks, 55, 57, 59, at the first level just opposite the Laundry Room). They've got ovens, actual stoves, basins, vending machines selling snacks, and then lockers to keep your possessions safe.\n4. Toilet is cleaned up to 6 times a day on weekdays, and zero times on weekends (from my block's experience). For floor 12 at least, it's 8am 10am 1pm 5pm 7pm. So for other floors, I'd reckon give it a plus minus 45 minutes from the said timings. It's clean for floors occupied with less residents (basically Floor 12), but I cannot say the same for the other floors as there's easily 50 over people using the toilet. Each floor's toilet has 6 toilet bowls, 6 shower cubicles, 4 basins, and no urinals (yep no urinals cause the gender occupying the floors can change with each year).\n5. Quite easy. Laundry used to be activated by ezlink tapping. However, the provider has since switched to PayNow QR. It's just a dollar per wash (regardless of washer or dryer machine). There's 8 washers and 8 dryers in each laundry room. As for drying clothes, you can just use the drying cabinet located in your hostel room (it's hidden behind the whiteboard which is actually a door in itself). For larger laundry items like bedsheets, I recommend putting it through the dryer, or hanging at level 12 (but the hanging area is not protected from rain so just keep that in mind).",

The design is mainly engineering focused compared to something like royal academy.\n\nThe design stuff are tied to the engineering modules. So if calculus and math stuff scares you I suggest avoiding SUTD and look for a different course. Architecture students who come here for architecture via poly usually got rekt in the first year. I'm not a shill 😅. If math is second nature the course material wouldn't be too bad. The only design course is introduction to design. \n\nYou will get rekt in the first year if you didn't take A level subjects because most of it is an extension of a level subject materials (Chem, Bio, Physics, Math).  The time frame is pretty short so unless you can learn quickly you'll likely get rekt if you came from poly because the material would be 100% new. It's forgiving in the 1st year as you can use the term breaks to take makeup exams and get a low pass \"C\". Past 1st year you'll need to retake the module in extra terms which will increase the total course fees.",

In this comment, the user said \"There will be a ceremony where the sorting hat chooses your pillar.\". While the exact comment/post the user was replying to is not known, we can assume that it was likely another user asking for some clarification on the pillar selection process. This comment is very sarcastic and it does not help the user who asked the question at all, which makes it a negative comment. However, it is not a harmful comment and it could be argued that it was just the user's attempt at cracking a lighthearted joke, which then makes it a positive comment. Hence, these cases are ambigious and it's labelling depends on the degree of humour of the labeler. \n",

My interview went for around 20 minutes, fairly easy, they'll try to make you feel comfortable so don't worry about it. I wasn't asked any academic questions in the interview but I'm an international student so I had to go through a written test first, so that may be why my interview was a bit different. (Remember that the interview is to know you more as a person and whether you would fit in with the uni culture than your IQ). All the best :))",

Oh another is they will try to scare you by listing out their very aggressive curriculum, how you needa learn fast and u have to convince them you will thrive not survive in the fast paced curriculum. Bonus points if u state something unique about urself that they don't alr know abt in your application they obviously have read up. For example \"most fun hackathon experience\" or \"can take apart and rebuild a car engine\" etc etc. Anyways this was for me, if u read last years sutd interview thread shd find more info. Atb!",

For the courses, we typically cram a lot of content into the 14 weeks because we dont have as much specialisation as NUS and NTU to afford spreading it into 2 separate modules. School is smaller so it gets harder to get committed people in your CCAs (or 5th rows as we call them).\n\nAlso its a lot easier to get into SUTD and once you get in, you are guaranteed to get whichever pillar you pick. so its easy to get into CS compared to NUS/NTU. SUTD will consider your CCA and leadership skills, and your portfolio of projects. if you're interested in CS, i suggest making some projects, putting it on github and deploying it.

         "Current SUTD student here!\n\nI'm happy to help answer your questions about SUTD if you have any but here's my advice for you based on what you're asking.\n\nAs some have already mentioned, you don't need to \"qualify\" for CSD, you just need to be accepted into SUTD then you're free to choose whatever course you want during your third term of study.\n\nThe important thing to note here is that you're only choosing your course in your third term!! What this means is that courses in terms 1, 2 and 3 (sort of for term 3) are gonna be common for all SUTD students. This includes two compulsory physics mods. I don't mean to scare you but speaking as someone who did take H2 Physics, it's hard af. This is a sentiment shared by many in my cohort. On the bright side, you will be able to take these mods as S/U, or pass fail. This means that these mods won't affect your GPA so long as you pass the mods. That takes away a lot of the pressure of doing well.\n\nI do have friends with no physics background who survived the first two terms then proceeded to do CSD, or any of the other courses where physics isn't a big part. So don't be afraid to give it a go.\n\nWhat I would like to add on, as an extra piece of advice is, if you're sure you wanna do CS, SUTD is an option but it might not be the best option. SUTD is a place to explore more before truly deciding on what you wanna do. Don't come in with CS tunnel vision! You'll find your first two or three terms a lot less enjoyable that way. Be open to learning about other things and who knows! You might end up choosing Architecture HAHA",

I myself got in through early admission! \n\nI'm not sure if they've changed anything but here's the process that took place for me.\n\nI got a message from my JC to apply for early admission. I'm not sure about applying on your own, that's just how it happened for me c':\n\nThey took a look at my prelim results and then invited me to a workshop to attend. During this workshop they introduced the SUTD curriculum and the SUTD way and culture. It's basically a design thinking workshop that introduces you to important concepts you will learn throughout your SUTD years.\n\nAfter the workshop, we were grouped up and then went to attend a group interview. My interview was with one interviewer and 3 interviewees. They asked me the usual questions, like where do I see myself in X years. They did also ask about SUTD specific things like whether I like making things and how I tackle a problem I don't have the answer to or have no experience doing.\n\nI've had friends tell me they've had physics and math questions in their interview but I didn't face that so I'm not sure.\n\nAfter the interview they eventually emailed me saying they wanted to see my A-level results before informing me of my admission results. I did have a U in my prelims so that might have been the reason for that but I can't be too sure.\n\nJust be yourself! The skills and people they're tryna look for are people who are willing to learn and better themselves. People who aren't afraid to fail so that they can learn! For example, I mentioned having no computing education or experience but mentioned I liked watching videos on youtube to learn and have been watching CS50 lectures as well. An appreciation for a holistic education is a plus too. \n\nAll the best and hope to see you in SUTD!",

That being said workload for each mod is higher compared to mods of other unis. Mods definitely get harder the more senior you become, but I've never seen anyone unable to complete their projects/assignments. May have to pull the occasional late night, but that's expected at any uni.\n2. That question is very vague. I'd say each week there is a new concept taught, and you are expected to practice and understand it on your own using materials/google.\n3. Yes. SUTD is one of the only Uni's where all mods have small classes. Lectures are not a given, meaning content is taught in a small class setting.\n4. Fifth rows in SUTD really depend on what you are interested in, many also take the opportunity to pick up a new hobby.",

She reported him to OSA and he was placed under disciplinary probation, and eventually dropped out due to the pressure the school management was putting him under + social ostracisation when everyone rallied around her. \n\nKeep receipts, keep evidence. Report to OSA with an email regarding your concerns immediately. The school actually takes a zero tolerance approach regarding these matters. That other weirdo only stayed in SUTD for a few months and left because \"bullying\", so I'd take his words with a lake of salt.

Likewise, for the post I made in reddit detailing my life experience, you  (and the others) can continue framing it as flimsy; there is sufficient evidence that is kept from 2011 till now (including my education records).\n\nBut unlike you, I don't have to hide behind a throwaway account when I say these things or when I do my social impact work because I have nothing to hide. What about you?\n\nFor all the \"bad karma\" I am accumulating, it must be retribution that I am now having a much better life compared to when I was at SUTD. For all the \"bad karma\" I accumulated when I was in SP, the truth came out when it was shown that I was actually backstabbed by that same group of people who claimed I was (insert whatever viles words you want). Admit it, you just don't wish to see the current narrative being challenged by an outlier's narrative.\n\nSo yea, instead of trying to throw malicious slander around (which, to be frank, just proves the point that I made recently in a mental health conference) and projecting on me, maybe learn to grow up and stop acting like a jerk.",
